By contrast, U.S. Treasury bond yields fell by 7bps, 9bps, and 5bps, respectively  We suggest investors use the continuing rally in the fixed-income markets to sell duration and better insulate their portfolios from future increases in interest rates  Combined weekly and monthly reporting municipal bond funds recorded their second consecutive week of inflows, with $322mn in net new cash  S&P has joined Moody’s and Fitch in placing Puerto Rico on Credit Watch Negative and communicated that it expects to resolve the designation within the next several weeks, and that Puerto Rico could see up to a two notch downgrade  We compare the approach that the three rating agencies have taken towards Puerto Rico, and find that Moody’s has been the most aggressive in terms of which credits it placed on Watch Negative, S&P has given the clearest guidance and focused most on the GDB, and that the underlying weakness in the economy and liquidity issues have become the central concerns for all three rating agencies  Despite the heightened credit risk, Puerto Rico bond prices have risen over the last three weeks, and PRASA debt has rallied particularly significantly. PRASA debt is now trading at higher prices than PREPA and the GO  While the plan has yet to be publicly released, the press is reporting that Detroit has developed a new bankruptcy proposal in which pensioners would be treated somewhat better than unsecured bondholders. The plan is apparently dependent upon the approval of a 40yr lease of the water department in exchange for $47mn/year, and is expected to be filed in federal court within two weeks  Consider corporate credit risk for municipalities with significant employment and tax base dependence on a single company. We discuss Cupertino, CA and Redwood, WA in the context of recent quarterly earnings releases by Apple and Microsoft. Although Apple and Microsoft are both performing solidly, large singular credit exposures can be long-term problematic for the municipality they help support and surrounding areas  40 states saw their unemployment rates fall in December, but Puerto Rico’s unemployment rate rose by 0.7%, bringing it to 15.4%, or the highest level since August 2012 Low yields and ratios weigh on municipal levels Despite generally subdued supply, the rally in the municipal bond market finally hit a wall this week, as tax-exempt yields rose despite low supply and a continuing rally in the U.S. Treasury bond market. For the week, 5yr, 10yr, and 30yr municipal high grade yields rose by 4bps, 6bps, and 7bps, respectively. By contrast, U.S. Treasury bond yields in the same maturities fell by 7bps, 9bps, and 5bps, respectively.

Next week’s long term volume is expected to be subdued as well, with issuance scheduled to fall to just shy of $4bn (Exhibit 1). The average issuance for the comparable week over the past three years is also low at $4.5bn. In addition, $1bn of next week’s calendar will be for a State of Illinois GO financing (A3/A-/A-), which is outside of many higher quality investment mandates. Illinois last came to market in December, and 10yr bonds currently trade at 120bps over the high-grade scale, down significantly from a spread of 178bps before the pension reform was passed in November. Other large transactions next week include the $315.4mn San Diego County Regional Airport Authority Senior Special Facilities Revenue Bond deal for a rental car facility project (A3/A-/NR), of which $285mn is expected to be taxable, and $30.6mn tax-exempt non- AMT, and the $315mn University of Massachusetts Building Authority financing (Aa2/AA-/AA), the majority of which is expected to be tax-exempt, with a small taxable piece. The University of Massachusetts Building Authority last came to market in July, and the 10yr bonds currently trade at a spread of 35-40bps. We continue to advise clients to use the rally in the fixed-income markets to better insulate their portfolios from future increases in interest rates. As discussed in last week’s publication, investors should consider selling securities on the cusp of de minimis before the prices are adversely impacted by the tax rule, while increasing book yield, deceasing rate exposure, and lessening the overall tax burden 1/24/2014. The magnitude and direction of fund flows is supportive of our broader curve and credit views, as net Long-Term municipal fund flows have lost -$3.0bn thus far on the year, while Intermediate funds in aggregate are down just -$232mn, and High Yield funds are up in aggregate by $262mn. Further, evidence of the near term trend is supported by the ‘weekly’ net fund flows, which have been positive over each of the first four weeks of this year for Intermediate and High Yield funds, but have only been positive in two weeks for Long Term municipal flows. To be clear however, our view on rates, 10-Year U.S. Treasury reaching 3.25% by mid-2014, is not supportive of sustained inflows over the first half of the year. That said, even mixed flows would be a welcome change relative to municipal fund flow experience in 2013. Combined weekly and monthly reporting municipal bond funds recorded their second consecutive week of inflows, with $322mn in net new cash For the period ending 01/29/2014, combined weekly and monthly reporting municipal bond funds indicated their second consecutive week of inflows at $322mn (Exhibit 3).

S&P joins Moody’s and Fitch in placing Puerto Rico on Credit Watch Negative S&P joined Moody’s and Fitch in placing Puerto Rico on Credit Watch Negative late last Friday. The rating designation affects the GO, GDB, Retirement System, Highway Revenue, Transportation Revenue, and University of Puerto Rico credits. While S&P was the last rating agency to move on Puerto Rico, they gave more direct guidance with regards to the anticipated timing and severity of rating moves than either Moody’s or Fitch. S&P said that it expects to resolve the Credit Watch within the “next several weeks”(seemingly by mid-February) and that Puerto Rico could see up to a two notch downgrade. Moody’s and Fitch did not provide such precise guidance on the potential magnitude of their possible action or timing guideline. Moody’s placed Puerto Rico on credit watch on December 11th, and usually resolves Credit Watch designations within 45 to 180 days, so we might expect a resolution by min-June. Fitch placed Puerto Rico on credit watch on November 14th, and typically reacts within three months. February 14th represents the threemonth mark, but Fitch has only said to expect a resolution by the end of FY-2014. Beyond giving more direct market guidance, S&P further departed from the strategy employed by Moody’s and Fitch in choosing to place the GDB credit on credit watch first (along with several other Puerto Rico banks) due to heightened liquidity concerns, and then taking “related action” on the municipal bond ratings, given the Commonwealth’s reliance on GDB liquidity. Fitch does not rate the GDB, and while Moody’s stressed the importance of GDB liquidity in its rating review and put the GDB on credit watch negative as well, Moody’s Puerto Rico credit watch was driven by the credit’s fundamentals in general, not just a causal relationship with the GDB. GDB’s liquidity issues are tied to the health of the economy and budget, however, so at the end of the day fundamentals played a role for all three rating agencies. Exhibit 4 compares the Puerto Rico Credit Watch designations from the three rating agencies. As the table shows, Fitch moved first, and has had Puerto Rico and its associated credits on Watch Negative since mid-November (73 days), although it was the last rating agency to place Puerto Rico on negative outlook earlier in 2013.

# sample_text = """ Economic Research says 11th onomatopoeia Note Oil and the global economy  Sustained big oil price declines have big growth impacts  History teaches that separating demand and supply impulses is key to projecting what comes next  We estimate 55% of this year’s oil price decline owes to a supply shock; 40% reflects weaker EM growth  Assuming supply shock response is still coming, global growth to get 0.7%-pt (ar) boost over two quarters The price of crude oil has fallen precipitously, made all the more remarkable given expectations that it will remain at these new lows for some time or perhaps even fall further. Since the start of the year, the price of Brent crude has plunged roughly 35%, the bulk of which has occurred in just the last three months. Declines of this magnitude are relatively rare and have tended to be associated with significant swings in global growth—generally recessions reflecting the impact of preceding price spikes. However, there have been two episodes over the past 30 years in which oil price drops of roughly 40%oya were not associated with global recessions. In both 1986 and in 1997-8, sharp declines preceded a DM growth surge. Indeed, in both episodes, DM growth rose above 4.5% for a full year, representing the two strongest phases of global GDP gains over the past quarter century. That oil price drops have been associated with both sharply slowing and accelerating demand reflects that there are powerful demand and supply shocks buffeting the market. It also reflects non-linearities that magnify the effect of large oil price movements over short periods of time. For gradual movements in oil prices, substitution effects in business and household spending diminish the direct effect on growth. However, for concentrated oil price spikes, the growth impact is dominated by the income effect on households, many of whom are liquidity constrained.  These effects are often reinforced by the monetary policy response to large oil price shocks. Similarly, increases in oil prices over a maturing expansion have tended to reinforce trends in monetary policy tightening. At the peak, tight monetary policy combined with oil’s negative income effects help tip the global economy into recession. In the two cases cited above, however, where oil price declines were not associated with recession, monetary policy eased. As oil prices fell in 1986, DM official rates fell close to 200bp. During 1998 and early 1999, policy rates were cut 80bp.  separate the impact of supply and demand shocks on global GDP (see “Modeling linkages between global GDP and oil prices,” GDW, February 17, 2012; and the appendix for a brief description). The model suggests that a 35% drop in oil prices due entirely to supply shocks would add roughly 0.5% to global GDP. Assuming this adjustment occurs over two quarters, the boost to global GDP becomes 1% annualized. Over time, this lift to growth would be expected to have positive multiplier effects on other components of demand. However, it also would involve oil prices moving higher as global demand picks up. However, our model shows that a 35% drop in oil prices is also consistent with a negative global demand shock of 1.5%- pts. The drop in oil prices would cushion the decline in global GDP, producing a net decline of about 1.2%, but both oil and demand should be expected to fall. Identifying the source of oil price shocks Thus, when assessing an oil price shock’s implications for the outlook, it is important to identify its source. In this regard, we attribute the current decline in global oil prices primarily to two developments:  A positive supply shock. Global energy production has been on a rising trajectory supported by increases North America and North Africa. The resulting negative price impact has been amplified by an increasing reluctance of OPEC members to scale back output as an offset. Indeed, despite relatively steady OPEC oil production in recent years, global oil output has surged 4.5mbd since 2007 and is up 1.3mbd in this year alone. The November OPEC meeting ended without any agreement. Our baseline outlook is that some OPEC supply cutbacks will come in 1Q15 but that this only gradually raises oil prices to $88/bbl by 4Q15; our conviction is relatively low at 60%, with the other 40% seeing prices move below $70/bbl and perhaps to as low as $60/bbl by early next year.  A negative demand shock focused in the EM. There has been a negative demand shock as global GDP decelerated this year. On a Q4/Q4 basis, global GDP growth looks to have stepped down from a modestly above-trend pace of 3.1% in 2013 to a slightly below-trend pace of 2.4% this year. Similarly, our Forecast Revision Index (FRI)—which better captures economic surprises as opposed to contours in growth—has fallen 0.7%-pt this year. Much of the global growth slowdown (as well as the FRI surprise) is due to the EM, where GDP has decelerated 1%-pt this year and the FRI has fallen over 1%-pt. The magnitudes are half as large for the DM on both metrics. The larger disappointment in the EM is important for the oil market given that oil prices  about 45% of the recent plunge in oil prices, leaving 55% of the price decline owing to stronger supply. The impulse from the oil supply shock The model used to identify the source of demand and supply shocks in global GDP and oil prices is static but in practice the moves have been more staggered. The global growth disappointment largely occurred earlier this year, and oil prices did not start dropping materially until September. Indeed, in retrospect, the lack of an oil response to the demand shortfall in 1H14 should have come as a bit of a surprise. Perhaps geopolitical risk premia (surrounding the Ukrainian crisis and ongoing negotiations with Iran) or stockbuilding in China explain the failure of oil to respond promptly to weak EM demand. Assuming that the impact of the estimated oil supply shock is only now being felt, we can use our model to explore the magnitude of the coming boost to GDP growth. As a rule of thumb, the model indicates that a 10% decline in the price of oil adds roughly 0.14%-pt to global GDP over a year. It is important to note that this impact accounts for all of the complex endogenous responses of growth and prices. For example, while the direct impact of a 10% price decline on DM growth is 50% larger than that of EM, the much larger sensitivity of EM growth to a stronger DM implies that the full impact on EM growth (0.18%-pt) is ultimately a touch stronger than the final impact on DM growth (0.12%-pt). With these dynamics in mind, the supply shock identified above—worth roughly a 25% decline in the price of oil—adds 0.36%-pt to global GDP growth. If we assume this impact occurs over two quarters, this suggests a 0.7%-pt add to annualized global GDP growth in the current quarter and next. For the DM, the boost is worth 0.6%-pt annualized over the two quarters. For the EM, the impact is larger given that the region gets the boost from lower oil prices and from a stronger DM. The add to EM GDP growth amounts to 0.9%- pt annualized over two quarters, half of which owes to stronger DM growth. Note that the lift to EM growth from the supply shock assumes that the previous negative EM demand shock is already incorporated. However, this raises a key outlook question. If we have gauged underlying demand conditions correctly, then there is a substantial boost to growth in the pipeline over the coming quarters as a result of the decline in oil prices. However, our bottom-up forecasts for EM economies have continued to move lower in recent weeks. Indeed, we have lowered our 2015 growth outlook a further 0.6% over the past two months. Appendix: A simple equilibrium model of oil and GDP The estimated impact of oil supply shocks on GDP growth traces out the demand curve for oil. This is written in terms of GDP growth (as a proxy for oil demand growth) and growth in the price of oil. For expositional purposes, real GDP growth is on the left-hand side of the equation: DM and EM demand curves for oil DM real GDP growth = 1.4+0.1*(EM real GDP growth - 5.5)-0.015*(Oil price growth)+DM demand shock EM real GDP growth = 4.6+0.9*(DM real GDP growth - 1.6)-0.010*(Oil price growth)+EM demand shock In addition to the impact of changes in the price of oil on real GDP growth—separated by region—the demand relationships allow for demand shocks that shift the demand curve either up or down relative to oil price changes. The relationships also allow for an interaction between DM and EM GDP growth. We allow EM growth to respond more strongly to moves in DM GDP growth. In general, the EM has a near unit beta relationship with DM growth. That is, a demand shock in DM GDP growth impacts EM GDP growth one-for-one. By contrast, there is a much smaller impact of demand shocks in EM GDP growth on DM GDP growth, as indicated by the estimated coefficients in the demand equations (the feedback between DM and EM growth ramps up the initial size of the coefficients). Based on these demand curves, if the price of oil is flat and there are no demand shocks, then real GDP is growing at trend in both the DM (1.4%) and EM (4.6%). The estimated impact of GDP growth on the price of oil traces out the supply curve for oil. As with the demand curve, the supply curve is written in terms of real GDP growth and growth in the price of oil. For expositional purposes, oil price growth is on the left-hand side of the equation. Global supply curve for oil Oil price growth = -37*(mbd supply shock)+6*(DM real GDP growth-1.6)+12*(EM real GDP growth-5.5) In addition to the impact of both DM and EM real GDP growth on the price of oil, the supply relationship also allows for a supply shock (in terms of millions of barrels per day additional supply). According to empirical estimates in the literature, a 1mbd rise/decline in the supply of oil lowers/increases the price of oil by 37%, all else equal. If both the DM and EM are growing at trend and there are no supply shocks, then the price of oil is constant. Implicitly, this assumes that oil producers are increasing the supply of oil by just enough to keep up with demand growth and thus keep prices unchanged. In terms of the four factors underlying the relationship between the price of oil and economic activity (in the first section of this report), this simple model only addresses two. The model (1) distinguishes between supply and demand forces and (2) provides empirical estimates of the net impact on GDP growth and oil prices from differences across consumer and suppliers of oil. However, the model abstracts from issues surrounding (3) timing and (4) the endogenous response of supply shocks to global demand and potential nonlinearities. A richer model would be needed to address these issues. Our general equilibrium oil/growth model can be used to deconstruct movements in growth and oil prices into the shares attributed to supply shocks and demand shocks. Unfortunately, the model is over-identified in that there is a wide range of potential shocks that can generate the outcomes seen in DM and EM growth and oil price moves. However, using the demand shocks identified above, the implicit magnitude of the oil supply shock can be isolated and thus quantified in the context of the model. According to our FRIs, most of the demand shock comes from the EM. Along with the region’s disproportionate impact on oil prices, we estimate the weaker-than-anticipated EM demand (i.e., the shock) contributed roughly 40% of the $35/bbl tumble in the price of crude oil since June. This is in sharp contrast to the meager 5% contribution from modestly weaker DM growth as detailed above. Combined, weaker global growth explains  The continued softness in EM growth hints that the share of the recent fall in the price of oil may owe even more to a demand shock than the 45% we are currently assuming. This would then imply a smaller supply shock and thus a lesser lift to global GDP growth. Still, even if EM demand accounts for a larger portion of the fall in oil prices, the positive impact on DM growth is still substantial given that DM sensitivities are much larger to oil prices than to EM growth. In terms of the four factors underlying the relationship between the price of oil and economic activity (in the first section of this report), this simple model only addresses two. The model (1) distinguishes between supply and demand forces and (2) provides empirical estimates of the net impact on GDP growth and oil prices from differences across consumer and suppliers of oil. However, the model abstracts from issues surrounding (3) timing and (4) the endogenous response of supply shocks to global demand and potential nonlinearities. A richer model would be needed to address these issues. ",
