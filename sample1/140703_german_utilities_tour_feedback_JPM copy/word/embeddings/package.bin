                               RWE and E.ON
                  German utilities investor tour feedback

  Nathalie F Casali (44-20) 7134-9023 nathalie.x.casali@jpmorgan.com (AC)


On July 1st we hosted group meetings with Klaus Schaffer, E.ON's CFO,
Stein Dale, E.ON's Head of Strategy, Peter Terium, RWE's CEO, and Martin
Hermann, CEO of RWE East. RWE conveyed the vision of a leaner group
focused on downstream with a free option in power generation, which in our
view continues to contrast favorably with E.ON (see links to previous
research in the right panel). That being said, at these levels we see more
potential value in the latter (positive gearing to a CO2 recovery and
German capacity markets, growth options outside of Europe). Near term,
however, we would expect investors to continue reducing underweight
positions indiscriminately in both E.ON and RWE given the perceived
potential upside from capacity payments, higher power prices, further cost
cutting and a burden sharing deal with the government on long-term nuclear
liabilities.
* German political backdrop: benign, not yet supportive. According to
E.ON and RWE, the reformed EEG law will change very little for
conventional utilities, with renewable additions simply slowing down versus
2012/13. RWE's lignite mining business will continue to be exempt from
the EEG levy for now, but there is no clarity beyond 2016 (maximum
downside to EBIT €190m p.a. or 10% of 2017 EPS). Both companies
reiterated their wishes for a non-discriminatory capacity market but E.ON
management in particular is realistic about the likelihood of the system
being geographically and technologically selective. Timing wise, the
capacity market design should be finalized by the end of this year and a
white paper should be published by the middle of next year. This will be
followed by a consultation with the EU and other countries which may lead
to legislation before 2016.
* No discussions on a nuclear "bad utility". Both companies reiterated that
there are currently no discussions with politicians on the subject of a
potential burden sharing agreement on long term nuclear liabilities, though
clearly they would be open to this. As detailed in our May 15th note,
unburdening E.ON and RWE of their long term fuel storage liabilities (the
most sensitive topic from the point of view of public health and the
environment) could potentially accrete equity values by €6.6bn and €5.5bn,
respectively. Any potential negotiation will likely take several years to
conclude, in our view.
* Generation a free option? Both companies expect their generation
businesses will not turn cash negative on a mark to market basis (according
to E.ON, €1.2bn of EBITDA in the medium term is a reasonable objective,
which would allow the company to cover both maintenance capex of c€0.3-
0.4bn and cash outflows related to nuclear liabilities of c€0.8bn).
According to RWE, with coal prices having bottomed out (which we do not
think is evident, as per JPM coal analysts' latest report) and plans for
capacity payments being drawn up in the UK and Germany, generation now
represents a free option. That the business stays cash positive remains a
strict requirement and further cost cutting efforts, if necessary, will
ensure this is the case.
* Clear vision of the equity story transformation at RWE. RWE's CEO thus
conveyed a clear message of deep equity story transformation, in our view.
Following the sale of DEA (which is very likely to complete, with the
government expected to give its view on the deal by the end of the year),
RWE's refinancing requirements should be very manageable. However,
management continues to consider that a 3.0x economic leverage target is
prudent, and it is also an important point of focus for the company's
internal focus on efficiency. Our view however remains that the leverage
target could be reviewed over the next 18-24 months. The group remains
very focused on FCF generation (including working capital management) and
a third cost cutting wave will be announced, most likely in March 2015.
Given the above, and with cash costs of nuclear decommissioning expected
to stay stable at €0.3-0.4bn p.a. for the next decade, we believe a return
to growth capex or indeed a payout ratio increase (though obviously
politically unadvisable near term) are options that will be considered
once the company has "earned its right to grow again".
* More uncertainty about the future shape of the group at E.ON. Our
perception remains that there is less strategic clarity at E.ON than at
RWE, partly because of the group's higher geographical and business
diversification.
Management is pleased with the progress of its Turkish business, whilst it
continues to focus on stabilizing Eneva before further growth options are
examined. E&P is managed as a standalone business, given the lack of
synergies with the rest of the group. Capex over the next few years will
focus on renewables, distributed energy and regulated grids. Cost cutting
efforts will continue, potentially beyond the need to offset inflation,
but the company does not expect to communicate group-wide targets at this
stage. Management says it will rotate assets on an opportunistic basis (no
comment on press reports of a disposal process in Italy or Spain). In
summary, E.ON's diversification seems to be less of an advantage versus
peers (particularly RWE) than it could be.

J.P. Morgan ratings or designations: OW = Overweight, N= Neutral, UW =
Underweight, NR = Not Rated 
Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s)
Coverage Universe: J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system:
Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will
outperform the average total return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the
analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total
return of the stocks in the analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage
universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this
stock will underperform the average total return of the stocks in the
analyst's (or the analyst's team's) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR):
J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if applicable, the price target,
for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis
or for legal, regulatory or policy reasons. The previous rating and, if
applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR
designation is not a recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-
Australia) and U.K. small- and mid-cap equity research, each stock's
expected total return is compared to the expected total return of a
benchmark country market index, not to those analysts' coverage universe.
If it does not appear in the Important Disclosures section of this report,
the certifying analyst's coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan's
