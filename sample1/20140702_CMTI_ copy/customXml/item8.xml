      <SubTitle>Strategies for Rules-based and Algorithmic Investors 2 July 2014</SubTitle>
      <Abstract>Our iTraxx Main Technical Indicators (latest spread level 58.50bp S21, all spreads in this document and in our calculations are roll-adjusted): 


Momentum Indicator: Long risk trade 23 May 69.00bp


Directional Movement Indicator: No trade at present 


Relative Strength Index: No trade at present 


House of Cards Indicator:  No trade at present 


Regime Switching Indicator:  Trending mode, Momentum long risk trade 1 July 59.75bp


We track the performance of two portfolios – Portfolio A which is an equally weighted average of Momentum, DMI, RSI and House of Cards.  And separately, the Regime Switching Indicator on its own.


Portfolio A P&amp;L over the past 12 months is 10.4bp, and 0.3bp YTD, Regime Switching model P&amp;L over the past 12 months is 30.9bp, and -2.8bp YTD

While we try not to put too much emphasis on “technical analysis”, we have found that our indicators would have historically provided very good results for rules-based/algorithmic investors. The signals are also interesting to look at from the perspective of gauging how much impetus there is behind market moves – some indicators attempt to confirm whether a trend has been established, while the others attempt to signal turning points.


Since our previous publication, our mean reversion indicators that put on short risk trades in early June have been forced to stop out of their trades.  


As the pace of spread tightening has slowed, our Momentum model could close out of its long-held sell protection trade if spreads widen to the low-60s.
