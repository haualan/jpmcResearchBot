Credit Market Technical Indicators: Strategies for Rules-based and
Algorithmic Investors 2 July 2014
Our iTraxx Main Technical Indicators (latest spread level 58.50bp S21, all
spreads in this document and in our calculations are roll-adjusted):

Momentum Indicator: Long risk trade 23 May 69.00bp

Directional Movement Indicator: No trade at present

Relative Strength Index: No trade at present

House of Cards Indicator:  No trade at present

Regime Switching Indicator:  Trending mode, Momentum long risk trade 1
July 59.75bp

We track the performance of two portfolios – Portfolio A which is an
equally weighted average of Momentum, DMI, RSI and House of Cards.  And
separately, the Regime Switching Indicator on its own.

Portfolio A P&L over the past 12 months is 10.4bp, and 0.3bp YTD, Regime
Switching model P&L over the past 12 months is 30.9bp, and -2.8bp YTD

While we try not to put too much emphasis on “technical analysis”, we have
found that our indicators would have historically provided very good
results for rules-based/algorithmic investors. The signals are also
interesting to look at from the perspective of gauging how much impetus
there is behind market moves – some indicators attempt to confirm whether
a trend has been established, while the others attempt to signal turning
points.

Since our previous publication, our mean reversion indicators that put on
short risk trades in early June have been forced to stop out of their
trades.

As the pace of spread tightening has slowed, our Momentum model could
close out of its long-held sell protection trade if spreads widen to the
low-60s.

                                        As the pace of spread tightening has slowed, our Momentum model could close out of its long-held sell protection trade if spreads widen to the low-60s.
