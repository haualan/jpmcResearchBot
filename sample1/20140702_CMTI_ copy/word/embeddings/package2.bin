While we try not to put too much emphasis on “technical analysis”, we have
found that our indicators would have historically provided very good
results for rules-based/algorithmic investors. The signals are also
interesting to look at from the perspective of gauging how much impetus
there is behind market moves – some indicators attempt to confirm whether
a trend has been established, while the others attempt to signal turning
points.

Since our previous publication, our mean reversion indicators that put on
short risk trades in early June have been forced to stop out of their
trades.

As the pace of spread tightening has slowed, our Momentum model could
close out of its long-held sell protection trade if spreads widen to the
low-60s.
