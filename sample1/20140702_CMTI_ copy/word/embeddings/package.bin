* Our iTraxx Main Technical Indicators (latest spread level 58.50bp S21,
all spreads in this document and in our calculations are roll-adjusted):
Momentum Indicator: Long risk trade 23 May 69.00bp
Directional Movement Indicator: No trade at present
Relative Strength Index: No trade at present
House of Cards Indicator:  No trade at present
Regime Switching Indicator:  Trending mode, Momentum long risk trade 1 July
59.75bp
* We track the performance of two portfolios - Portfolio A which is an
equally weighted average of Momentum, DMI, RSI and House of Cards.  And
separately, the Regime Switching Indicator on its own.
* Portfolio A P&L over the past 12 months is 10.4bp, and 0.3bp YTD, Regime
Switching model P&L over the past 12 months is 30.9bp, and -2.8bp YTD

* While we try not to put too much emphasis on "technical analysis", we
have found that our indicators would have historically provided very good
results for rules-based/algorithmic investors. The signals are also
interesting to look at from the perspective of gauging how much impetus
there is behind market moves - some indicators attempt to confirm whether
a trend has been established, while the others attempt to signal turning
points. * Since our previous publication, our mean reversion indicators
that put on short risk trades in early June have been forced to stop out
of their trades. * As the pace of spread tightening has slowed, our
Momentum model could close out of its long-held sell protection trade if
spreads widen to the low-60s.

Regime Switching Indicator
Our Momentum strategy is a simple, intuitive algorithm designed for
trending markets (pg 5).  Generally speaking, the nature of Momentum
strategies is that they do not work well when markets are range-trading.
This has led us to search for a model that can identify when the market is
range trading or trending.  By using a regime switching indicator, we can
move between Momentum and range-trading strategies.
Method:
Bollinger Bands
A simple range-trading strategy is to trade spreads between a rolling +/-
2 standard deviation range (i.e. Bollinger Bands).  This model puts on a
short risk trade, when spreads cross from below to above the lower
boundary (defined by the average spreads minus 2 standard deviations). 
The take profit level is when spreads cross the upper boundary, and the
stop loss is if spreads cross back below the lower boundary. When spreads
are outside of the +/- 2 standard deviation boundaries, there is no trade.

However, because during the short history of European credit indices the
most volatile (i.e. more profitable) periods have been trending, the
backtesting results for Bollinger Bands are unimpressive (see Figure 1). 
It did, however, perform well over the most recent range trading periods
-3Q09 and July to August 2010. Historically, Bollinger Bands and Momentum
have only had the same position on 25% of the time.  Hence if we can find
a successful regime switching signal, then we can alternate between
Bollinger Bands and Momentum for range-trading and trending environments
respectively.
Average single name
correlation approximation

Regime Switching Signal
One potential way to do this is by looking at the extent to which single
names move together.  In trending environments, when systemic risk factors
are more important, you would expect a higher level of correlation in
spread movements between the single names in the index.
We look at spread volatility (as a percentage) for the index and the
duration weighted average of the single names.  We then use an
approximation to get average single name correlation.
In order to decide whether we should use the Momentum or Bollinger band
strategy at a given time, we look at whether this correlation measure is
above or below a certain threshold (if it is higher, i.e. single names
more correlated, then trade Momentum, otherwise use Bollinger Bands).  The
threshold is a moving average of the single name correlations over the
prior month. In Figure 2 below, when the latest average single name
correlation is above the moving average threshold, our model interprets
this as signaling that iTraxx is in a trending regime and when it is below
the threshold, a range-trading regime is implied.
Figure 2: Regimes
[Image Removed]Source: J.P. Morgan. (due to the approximation used, the
correlation measure can exceed 1.00) P&L:
Using this to determine when to use Momentum and Bollinger Bands leads to a
significant improvement in both the cumulative P&L profiles and
information ratios.
Although the number of trades rises, so does the average P&L per trade.
Cumulatively, a regime switching strategy initiated in October 2006 would
have made 526bp or 70p per year, or 3.16% of notional assuming a duration
of 4.5 and ignoring carry. (This would translate into a 31.6% return on
margin, assuming a conservative 10% margin for iTraxx Main.)
In backtesting, many algorithmic strategies' performance are heavily
dependent on signals in 2008-2009.  Although the regime switching strategy
P&L was flat over 2H09, it avoided the heavy losses incurred by Momentum. 
Using the full history of data we have from 2004, the time spent in
range-trading versus trending environments has been split 50-50, but in
total, 2/3 of the P&L has come from the Momentum strategy.

Trades:
Markets have been trading within a tight range, and average single name
correlation has been fluctuating around the thresholds we use to determine
whether the model should follow Momentum or Bollinger Band signals, which
has caused the model to switch frequently between trades.  At present, the
model is in trending mode and is following the Momentum long risk signal. 
The Bollinger band model is in short risk mode, targeting 62.25bp, with a
stop-loss at 56.125bp. Figure 4: Regime Switching Model signals

Momentum
Method:
* Our measure of momentum looks at the 5-day (or weekly) moving average
relative to the 20-day (or monthly) moving average on an exponentially
weighted basis, giving more weighting to recent observations. If the weekly
moving average is below the monthly moving average, market participants are
selling protection - pushing spreads ever tighter - and momentum is likely
to continue.
* A trade is held until an opposing signal is given, such that there is an
active trade at all times.  We have found good results from this strategy
over the past two years.  Figure 5 shows the iTraxx Main index, with the
turning indicators of momentum marked in red (long risk) and green (short
risk).
P&L:
* Cumulatively, a momentum-based strategy initiated in October 2006 would
have made 187bp or 25bp per year, or 1.12% of notional assuming a duration
of 4.5 and ignoring carry. (This would translate into an 11.2% return on
margin, assuming a conservative 10% margin for iTraxx Main.)
* While these are impressive returns, we note that momentum has not been
great at picking the turning points in the market and needs to wait for a
trend to establish before generating a signal. The biggest loss from the
strategy would have come in March 2008 following the market sell-off and
subsequent rally. While we did catch the rally, we lost the initial turn.
Trades:
* The Momentum model has continued to profit from the long risk trade it
initiated towards the end of May.  The slowdown in the pace of the spread
tightening has narrowed the gap between the two moving averages to less
than 1bp, meaning the model could switch to short risk if spreads move
towards the low-60s.

Directional Movement Indicator
Method:
* Like Momentum, this indicator also aims to identify trends rather than
turning points.  Its calculation is akin to the RSI in the sense that it
looks at day-on-day changes, but instead of tracking closing marks, we
look at changes in intraday highs and lows, normalized by average daily
trading ranges. * We calculate a widening indicator that measures the
strength of upward trends in spreads and a corresponding tightening
indicator.  A trade signal is generated when one trend indicator crosses
the other, i.e. when one trend is identified as being significantly
stronger (see Figure 6) * Trades become most profitable when the absolute
gap between the widening indicator and the tightening indicator reaches a
peak (i.e. these points coincide with turning points on Main).  Our model
keeps a trade on until the gap between the two indicators reaches the
maximum gap seen within the past month, such that take-profit levels adapt
to the volatility of the recent trading environment. * This works better
when spreads are range trading, but results in the fact that the model
takes profits too early in a trending environment like that seen over the
crisis (but in that scenario, we would hope our Momentum model would
become the primary driver of P&L).  However, we believe there are
diversification benefits by making this adaptation to the model, as
previously, the P&L at times tended to be quite correlated to our Momentum
model.
P&L:
* Cumulatively, a DMI strategy initiated in October 2006 would have made
201bp, or approximately 27bp per year, or 1.21% of notional assuming a
duration of 4.5 and ignoring carry. (This would translate into a 12.1%
return on margin per annum, assuming a conservative 10% margin for iTraxx
Main.) * Like momentum, signals tend to come after turning points and the
strategy does not tend to perform as well in range bound environments.
Trades:
* Not surprisingly, the tightening trend is currently more dominant, but
the model has missed the opportunity to enter into a long risk trade.

Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Method:
* This indicator monitors the relative strength and speed of day-on-day
spread moves wider versus moves tighter, by looking at the ratio of
average moves wider versus tighter over a certain lookback period.  This
ratio is then transformed into a number between 0 and 100 and we then aim
to identify when the market has become oversold (when the RSI is above 70)
or overbought (RSI <30). * Because of the way the indicator is calculated,
signals tend to occur a day after the actual peak in spreads and are for
short trading horizons of up to a week.  We have also attempted to build
in stop-loss levels (if the RSI dips below 30 again or rises above 70) and
take profit levels (if the RSI is approaching 50). * The RSI tends to give
counter-trend signals - Figure 7 illustrates that since July 2007, where
the main trend has been spread widening, the indicator has been successful
at identifying the majority of the main peaks, but not as good at picking
up the troughs. This is why technical indicators such as this are best
used in conjunction with others and the most successful signals are when
more than one indicator signals within a short timespan.
P&L:
* Cumulatively, an RSI-based investment strategy initiated in October 2006
would have made 83bp or approximately 11bp per year or 0.50% of notional
assuming a duration of 4.5 and ignoring carry.  This P&L is considerable
given the short trading horizon of the model's signals. (This would
translate into a 5.0% return on margin p.a., assuming a conservative 10%
margin for iTraxx Main.) Trades:
* Spreads did widen slightly after the model initiated a short risk trade
on 11th June, but never quite reached the take profit level of 62bp.  The
resumption of the rally caused the model to close out its trade at a loss
of 1.125bp.  Currently, markets are viewed as balanced to slightly
overbought.

House of Cards Indicator
Method:
* This indicator generates a signal when there is a diversion between
iTraxx Main versus its historical relationship with measures of CDS basis
(both to theoretical and cash), Credit market volatility (ATM vol, vol
skew, correlation) and Other asset classes (equity vol, yield curve, swap
spreads). * We have used backtesting to determine what level of z-score
triggers a profitable trading signal (Z-score = (Yt- Ŷt)/σt ; where Yt is
the actual iTraxx Main spread at time t, Ŷt is the fitted value using the
other factors and σt is the standard error of the regression) for each of
the factors stated above. * Because of the way this indicator is
constructed, it tends to generate significantly fewer signals than
Momentum and RSI, but the trade horizon is longer. Unlike the other
indicators, once a signal is generated, a trade is held for a fixed
trading horizon of two weeks.
P&L:
* A strategy initiated in October 2006 would have made a cumulative P&L of
160bp or approximately 21bp per year, or 0.96% of notional assuming a
duration of 4.5 and ignoring carry. (This would translate into a 9.6%
return on margin, assuming a conservative 10% margin for iTraxx Main.)
Trades:
* The model closed out its most recent short risk trade on 19th June at a
loss of 4.25bp, as other markets and credit vol caught up with the rally
in iTraxx Main that started at the beginning of June.  Currently, the
model views spreads as fairly priced versus its input factors.

Explanation of Credit Research Ratings:
Ratings System: J.P. Morgan uses the following issuer portfolio
weightings: Overweight (over the next three months, the recommended risk
position is expected to outperform the relevant index, sector, or
benchmark), Neutral (over the next three months, the recommended risk
position is expected to perform in line with the relevant index, sector,
or benchmark), and Underweight (over the next three months, the
recommended risk position is expected to underperform the relevant index,
sector, or benchmark). J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Sovereign Research
uses Marketweight, which is equivalent to Neutral. NR is Not Rated. In
this case, J.P. Morgan has removed the rating for this security because of
either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory
or policy reasons. The previous rating no longer should be relied upon. An
NR designation is not a recommendation or a rating. NC is Not Covered. An
NC designation is not a rating or a recommendation. Analysts can rate the
issuer, the individual bonds of the issuer, or both. An issuer
recommendation applies to all of the bonds at the same level of the
issuer's capital structure, unless we specify a different recommendation
for the individual security. For CDS, we use the following rating system:
Long Risk (over the next three months, the credit return on the
recommended position is expected to exceed the relevant index, sector or
benchmark), Neutral (over the next three months, the credit return on the
recommended position is expected to match the relevant index, sector or
benchmark), and Short Risk (over the next three months, the credit return
on the recommended position is expected to underperform the relevant
index, sector or benchmark).

Valuation & Methodology: In J.P. Morgan's credit research, we assign a
rating to each issuer (Overweight, Underweight or Neutral) based on our
credit view of the issuer and the relative value of its securities, taking
into account the ratings assigned to the issuer by credit rating agencies
and the market prices for the issuer's securities. Our credit view of an
issuer is based upon our opinion as to whether the issuer will be able
service its debt obligations when they become due and payable. We assess
this by analyzing, among other things, the issuer's credit position using
standard credit ratios such as cash flow to debt and fixed charge coverage
(including and excluding capital investment). We also analyze the issuer's
ability to generate cash flow by reviewing standard operational measures
for comparable companies in the sector, such as revenue and earnings
growth rates, margins, and the composition of the issuer's balance sheet
relative to the operational leverage in its business.
