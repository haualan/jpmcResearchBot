By contrast, U.S. Treasury bond yields fell by 7bps, 9bps, and 5bps, respectively  We suggest investors use the continuing rally in the fixed-income markets to sell duration and better insulate their portfolios from future increases in interest rates  Combined weekly and monthly reporting municipal bond funds recorded their second consecutive week of inflows, with $322mn in net new cash  S&P has joined Moody’s and Fitch in placing Puerto Rico on Credit Watch Negative and communicated that it expects to resolve the designation within the next several weeks, and that Puerto Rico could see up to a two notch downgrade  We compare the approach that the three rating agencies have taken towards Puerto Rico, and find that Moody’s has been the most aggressive in terms of which credits it placed on Watch Negative, S&P has given the clearest guidance and focused most on the GDB, and that the underlying weakness in the economy and liquidity issues have become the central concerns for all three rating agencies  Despite the heightened credit risk, Puerto Rico bond prices have risen over the last three weeks, and PRASA debt has rallied particularly significantly. PRASA debt is now trading at higher prices than PREPA and the GO  While the plan has yet to be publicly released, the press is reporting that Detroit has developed a new bankruptcy proposal in which pensioners would be treated somewhat better than unsecured bondholders. The plan is apparently dependent upon the approval of a 40yr lease of the water department in exchange for $47mn/year, and is expected to be filed in federal court within two weeks  Consider corporate credit risk for municipalities with significant employment and tax base dependence on a single company. We discuss Cupertino, CA and Redwood, WA in the context of recent quarterly earnings releases by Apple and Microsoft. Although Apple and Microsoft are both performing solidly, large singular credit exposures can be long-term problematic for the municipality they help support and surrounding areas  40 states saw their unemployment rates fall in December, but Puerto Rico’s unemployment rate rose by 0.7%, bringing it to 15.4%, or the highest level since August 2012 Low yields and ratios weigh on municipal levels Despite generally subdued supply, the rally in the municipal bond market finally hit a wall this week, as tax-exempt yields rose despite low supply and a continuing rally in the U.S. Treasury bond market. For the week, 5yr, 10yr, and 30yr municipal high grade yields rose by 4bps, 6bps, and 7bps, respectively. By contrast, U.S. Treasury bond yields in the same maturities fell by 7bps, 9bps, and 5bps, respectively.

Morgan Securities LLC 3 performance, particularly if U.S. Treasury bond yields rise. This week’s new issue volume totaled $5.5bn, or marginally above our $5bn estimate for long-dated supply. Next week’s long term volume is expected to be subdued as well, with issuance scheduled to fall to just shy of $4bn (Exhibit 1). The average issuance for the comparable week over the past three years is also low at $4.5bn. In addition, $1bn of next week’s calendar will be for a State of Illinois GO financing (A3/A-/A-), which is outside of many higher quality investment mandates. Illinois last came to market in December, and 10yr bonds currently trade at 120bps over the high-grade scale, down significantly from a spread of 178bps before the pension reform was passed in November. Other large transactions next week include the $315.4mn San Diego County Regional Airport Authority Senior Special Facilities Revenue Bond deal for a rental car facility project (A3/A-/NR), of which $285mn is expected to be taxable, and $30.6mn tax-exempt non- AMT, and the $315mn University of Massachusetts Building Authority financing (Aa2/AA-/AA), the majority of which is expected to be tax-exempt, with a small taxable piece. The University of Massachusetts Building Authority last came to market in July, and the 10yr bonds currently trade at a spread of 35-40bps. We continue to advise clients to use the rally in the fixed-income markets to better insulate their portfolios from future increases in interest rates. As discussed in last week’s publication, investors should consider selling securities on the cusp of de minimis before the prices are adversely impacted by the tax rule, while increasing book yield, deceasing rate exposure, and lessening the overall tax burden 1/24/2014. The magnitude and direction of fund flows is supportive of our broader curve and credit views, as net Long-Term municipal fund flows have lost -$3.0bn thus far on the year, while Intermediate funds in aggregate are down just -$232mn, and High Yield funds are up in aggregate by $262mn. Further, evidence of the near term trend is supported by the ‘weekly’ net fund flows, which have been positive over each of the first four weeks of this year for Intermediate and High Yield funds, but have only been positive in two weeks for Long Term municipal flows. To be clear however, our view on rates, 10-Year U.S. Treasury reaching 3.25% by mid-2014, is not supportive of sustained inflows over the first half of the year. That said, even mixed flows would be a welcome change relative to municipal fund flow experience in 2013. Combined weekly and monthly reporting municipal bond funds recorded their second consecutive week of inflows, with $322mn in net new cash For the period ending 01/29/2014, combined weekly and monthly reporting municipal bond funds indicated their second consecutive week of inflows at $322mn (Exhibit 3). Among the larger fund subcategories, Long Term funds indicated $54mn in outflows, while Intermediate funds experienced $297mn in net inflows, and High Yield funds saw $301mn in net new cash this period.

S&P joins Moody’s and Fitch in placing Puerto Rico on Credit Watch Negative S&P joined Moody’s and Fitch in placing Puerto Rico on Credit Watch Negative late last Friday. The rating designation affects the GO, GDB, Retirement System, Highway Revenue, Transportation Revenue, and University of Puerto Rico credits. While S&P was the last rating agency to move on Puerto Rico, they gave more direct guidance with regards to the anticipated timing and severity of rating moves than either Moody’s or Fitch. S&P said that it expects to resolve the Credit Watch within the “next several weeks”(seemingly by mid-February) and that Puerto Rico could see up to a two notch downgrade. Moody’s and Fitch did not provide such precise guidance on the potential magnitude of their possible action or timing guideline. Moody’s placed Puerto Rico on credit watch on December 11th, and usually resolves Credit Watch designations within 45 to 180 days, so we might expect a resolution by min-June. Fitch placed Puerto Rico on credit watch on November 14th, and typically reacts within three months. February 14th represents the threemonth mark, but Fitch has only said to expect a resolution by the end of FY-2014. Beyond giving more direct market guidance, S&P further departed from the strategy employed by Moody’s and Fitch in choosing to place the GDB credit on credit watch first (along with several other Puerto Rico banks) due to heightened liquidity concerns, and then taking “related action” on the municipal bond ratings, given the Commonwealth’s reliance on GDB liquidity. Fitch does not rate the GDB, and while Moody’s stressed the importance of GDB liquidity in its rating review and put the GDB on credit watch negative as well, Moody’s Puerto Rico credit watch was driven by the credit’s fundamentals in general, not just a causal relationship with the GDB. GDB’s liquidity issues are tied to the health of the economy and budget, however, so at the end of the day fundamentals played a role for all three rating agencies. Exhibit 4 compares the Puerto Rico Credit Watch designations from the three rating agencies. As the table shows, Fitch moved first, and has had Puerto Rico and its associated credits on Watch Negative since mid-November (73 days), although it was the last rating agency to place Puerto Rico on negative outlook earlier in 2013. Moody’s has had Puerto Rico on negative outlook at the Baa3 level since December 2012, and placed the Commonwealth on Negative Watch Exhibit 5: Current Puerto Rico Ratings Source: Bloomberg, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch Exhibit 4: Puerto Rico Rating Agency Summary Action Source: Bloomberg, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch Exhibit 6: Liquidity has become the rating agencies’ primary concern Source: Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, J.P.

Moody’s has been the most aggressive in terms of which credits it placed on Watch Negative, assigning the designation to the GO, GDB, Retirement System, Highway Revenue, Transportation Revenue, PREPA, PRASA, COFINA, and University of Puerto Rico bonds. S&P did not place PREPA, PRASA, or COFINA on Credit Watch, although it does have a negative outlook on COFINA and PREPA. Fitch has not placed PREPA, PRASA, or COFINA on Credit Watch either, and does not rate the University of Puerto Rico, the GDB, or the Highway/Transportation Revenue Bonds.

sample_text = """ On July 1st we hosted group meetings with Klaus Schaffer, E.ON’s CFO, Stein Dale, E.ON’s Head of Strategy, Peter Terium, RWE’s CEO, and Martin Hermann, CEO of RWE East. RWE conveyed the vision of a leaner group focused on downstream with a free option in power generation, which in our view continues to contrast favorably with E.ON (see links to previous research in the right panel). That being said, at these levels we see more potential value in the latter (positive gearing to a CO2 recovery and German capacity markets, growth options outside of Europe). Near term, however, we would expect investors to continue reducing underweight positions indiscriminately in both E.ON and RWE given the perceived potential upside from capacity payments, higher power prices, further cost cutting and a burden sharing deal with the government on long-term nuclear liabilities.  


German political backdrop: benign, not yet supportive. According to E.ON and RWE, the reformed EEG law will change very little for conventional utilities, with renewable additions simply slowing down versus 2012/13. RWE’s lignite mining business will continue to be exempt from the EEG levy for now, but there is no clarity beyond 2016 (maximum downside to EBIT €190m p.a. or 10% of 2017 EPS). Both companies reiterated their wishes for a non-discriminatory capacity market but E.ON management in particular is realistic about the likelihood of the system being geographically and technologically selective. Timing wise, the capacity market design should be finalized by the end of this year and a white paper should be published by the middle of next year. This will be followed by a consultation with the EU and other countries which may lead to legislation before 2016. 


No discussions on a nuclear “bad utility”. Both companies reiterated that there are currently no discussions with politicians on the subject of a potential burden sharing agreement on long term nuclear liabilities, though clearly they would be open to this. As detailed in our May 15th note, unburdening E.ON and RWE of their long term fuel storage liabilities (the most sensitive topic from the point of view of public health and the environment) could potentially accrete equity values by €6.6bn and €5.5bn, respectively. Any potential negotiation will likely take several years to conclude, in our view. 


Generation a free option? Both companies expect their generation businesses will not turn cash negative on a mark to market basis (according to E.ON, €1.2bn of EBITDA in the medium term is a reasonable objective, which would allow the company to cover both maintenance capex of c€0.3-0.4bn and cash outflows related to nuclear liabilities of c€0.8bn). According to RWE, with coal prices having bottomed out (which we do not think is evident, as per JPM coal analysts’ latest report) and plans for capacity payments being drawn up in the UK and Germany, generation now represents a free option. That the business stays cash positive remains a strict requirement and further cost cutting efforts, if necessary, will ensure this is the case. 


Clear vision of the equity story transformation at RWE. RWE’s CEO thus conveyed a clear message of deep equity story transformation, in our view. Following the sale of DEA (which is very likely to complete, with the government expected to give its view on the deal by the end of the year), RWE’s refinancing requirements should be very manageable. However, management continues to consider that a 3.0x economic leverage target is prudent, and it is also an important point of focus for the company’s internal focus on efficiency. Our view however remains that the leverage target could be reviewed over the next 18-24 months. The group remains very focused on FCF generation (including working capital management) and a third cost cutting wave will be announced, most likely in March 2015. Given the above, and with cash costs of nuclear decommissioning expected to stay stable at €0.3-0.4bn p.a. for the next decade, we believe a return to growth capex or indeed a payout ratio increase (though obviously politically unadvisable near term) are options that will be considered once the company has “earned its right to grow again”.


More uncertainty about the future shape of the group at E.ON. Our perception remains that there is less strategic clarity at E.ON than at RWE, partly because of the group’s higher geographical and business diversification. Management is pleased with the progress of its Turkish business, whilst it continues to focus on stabilizing Eneva before further growth options are examined. E&amp;P is managed as a standalone business, given the lack of synergies with the rest of the group. Capex over the next few years will focus on renewables, distributed energy and regulated grids. Cost cutting efforts will continue, potentially beyond the need to offset inflation, but the company does not expect to communicate group-wide targets at this stage. Management says it will rotate assets on an opportunistic basis (no comment on press reports of a disposal process in Italy or Spain). In summary, E.ON’s diversification seems to be less of an advantage versus peers (particularly RWE) than it could be.  """
