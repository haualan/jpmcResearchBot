Curves and currencies: it shouldn’t matter much how 
Treasuries twist 

Outlook: 

This week a rare event occurred: volatility rose. It wasn’t by much or on 
meaningful volumes. More importantly, it wasn’t on a geopolitical event 
comparable to those which have turned the volatility cycle historically. 
Inflation still seems like the more material issue through its impact on Fed 
policy, front-end pricing and eventual real yields. But as if swings in US rates 
weren't hard enough to call, many ask too whether the shape of the Treasury 
curve will matter for currencies over this Fed cycle. This question reflects a 
recognition that the curve is moving in unusual ways this year, and a belief 
that the yield curve is a decent predictor of the business cycle. For the dollar, 
however, the shape of the curve is unreliable: there isn't much consistency 
between the currency's performance and regimes such as bull steepeners, bull 
flatteners, bear steepeners or bear flatteners. Stay focused on many aspects of 
the rates market (2s for G10 and EM, 10s for EM, real yields for both), but not 
so much the curve's shape across segments. 

Macro Trade Recommendations: 

Keep trades tactical and mainly idiosyncratic around four key themes. For 
carry, stay short USD/CNY and INR vols. To play central bank sensitivity to 
inflation, own USD vs NOK and PHP vs USD but take profits on long GBP vs 
NOK. For major balance of payments misalignment, stay short EUR/CHF. 
Keep vol hedges through GBP, CHF, NZD and AUD. 

Emerging Markets FX: 

In Latin America FX, stay overweight COP and underweight CLP in the GBIEM 
Model Portfolio; also hold long BRL/CLP. Be marketweight BRL and 
MXN: USD/BRL should hold a 2.20-2.25 range as BCB is likely to step up 
intervention through FX swap rollover should geopolitical risks linger. 

FX Derivatives: 

Deep OTM cross-yen puts are underpriced relative to typical left-tail moves in 
spot. EUR calls/EM puts are overvalued, while USD calls/EM puts are middle 
of the pack. Low premium risk-off option RVs to consider are a) cross-yen 
puts vs. USD/JPY puts and b) USD/EM calls vs. EUR/EM calls. Cross-yen vol 
curves are steep in the 6M-1Y segment. Sell 6M6M FVAs in positive carry 
long vol constructs such as 1X2 FVA spreads, or use the rolldown to fund the 
premium of AUD puts/JPY calls. 

Technical Strategy: 

The euro keeps on struggling to defend key support at 1.3477/68, which is the 
decisive T-junction. Recoveries of NOK and SEK would provide fresh selling 
opportunities. GBP has lost momentum but holds key supports. Stay long 
USD/JPY, USD/SEK, USD/NOK, EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD, USD/CZK, 
USD/CLP, MXN/CLP & short NZD/USD and CAD/MXN.

This week a rather rare event occurred: volatility rose. It 
wasn't by much (+0.2 vols on VXY Global and +0.25 vols 
on VXY EM), it wasn't on material volume (chart 1) and 
more importantly, its causes were not comparable to the 
geopolitical events which have turned the volatility cycle in 
previous decades. The twin conflicts in Russia and Israel 
obviously could escalate, but the bar is high for these to 
drive FX vol durably higher. Inflation still seems like the 
more material issue through its impact on Fed policy, front-
end pricing and eventually real yields. But as if swings in 
US rates weren't hard enough to call, many ask too whether

Crimea incursion in March nor this week's event with MH 
flight 17 rate – FX vols are up a trivial 0.2% on VXY. We 
have discussed before the intuitively obvious point that 
geopolitics can generate meaningful increases in volatility, 
and the probably less-obvious point that geopolitics is much 
less frequently the cause of significant vol spikes than 
monetary policy. Indeed, there have been about 20 instances 
over the past four decades when FX vol has fallen to very 
low levels, which we define as sub-7% on 3-mo realiseds. 
When vols have rallied from those extremes, the cause has 
usually been Fed tightening and its domestic and 
international spillovers such as US credit stress, emerging 
markets balance of payments crises and US 
slowdowns/recessions (see By the historical norm, 
volatility's undershoot is still early-stage in FX Markets 
Weekly published June 6). 

Chart 4 ranks those 20 vol shocks and shows the 
retracement higher in volatility in the three months after vol 
troughs. The only geopolitical events that generated durable 
moves in vol of more than two points were the two Iraq 
conflicts – Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the US 
invasion of Iraq in 2003. Other geopolitical shocks like the 
fall of the Berlin Wall/German Reunification in 1990 and 
even the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered 
more muted reactions when measured at monthly intervals. 
One caveat on timing, however: a political event like 
German Reunification eventually triggered a massive vol 
shock two years later as Bundesbank hikes to combat 
German inflation contributed substantially to the ERM 
Crisis, an event which ranks amongst the biggest FX vol 
shocks of the floating rate era. 

If history is any guide to how Russia could influence FX 
volatility going forward, the conflict in its current form 
does not seem so bullish for VXY. The first Iraq War was 
a vol generator because it triggered a major oil supply shock 
(OPEC output fell over 15% in 1990), while the Second 
Iraq War lifted vol through a minor supply disruption 
(OPEC output fell 5% that spring). German Reunification 
mattered because of its dramatic monetary policy 
consequences for a system of European fixed exchange 
rates. Thus, Russia would matter more for vol for more than 
a couple of days if events significantly upped the odds of a 
supply shock. That outcome seems unlikely, both because 
of Russia's self-interest in sustaining its energy exports and 
the US/EU's lack of interest much beyond diplomatic and 
financial sanctions. So as non-linear as this conflict has 
become, it still seems a stretch to think of this week’s 
events as a turning point for the FX volatility cycle.

Curves predicting cycles predicting 
currencies 

The turning point in vol will probably still be rate-
related rather than geopolitical, either because US 
activity and inflation data firm enough to push front-end 
rate expectations up towards the Fed dots (Dec 2016 OIS is 
still 75bp before Fed projections), or because inflation data 
cause the Fed to pull forward its expected start date for the 
tightening cycle. We suspect this repricing will move the

dollar index before year-end, since the US economy appears 
to be accelerating in several sectors (business surveys, 
housing, employment) while inflation has surprised to the 
upside in two of the past three months. A more precise 
forecast than this is depressingly impossible: since current 
money market pricing reflects skepticism of the FOMC’s 
guidance in the face of improving data, investors may be 
awaiting either data consistency or a Fed signal (either at 
the Jackson Hole symposium focusing on labour markets 
or the September FOMC press conference) before buying 
dollars. Alternatively, they simply await the passage of time, 
since the negative carry in bonds and some currencies 
(notably emerging markets, AUD and NZD) is punitive for 
the year or so it will take the Fed to start normalising policy. 

Assuming rates eventually move, a frequent client 
question is how much shifts in the yield curve matter for 
FX. This is an understandable question since there is some 
academic literature alleging that the yield curve predicts the 
business cycle, and since some presume that the dollar has a 
consistent relationship with US growth fluctuations. So by 
the usual commutative logic, if the curve predicts the 
business cycle and the business cycle predicts the currency, 
then the curve should predict the currency. For example, 
some assume that a steeper yield curve signals a growth 
upturn, with low short rates reflecting current stimulative 
monetary conditions and higher intermediate rates reflecting 
eventual tightening as growth accelerates. Conversely, 
many think that a flattening curve signals a slowdown, with 
high short rates reflecting restrictive policy and lower 
intermediate rates reflecting the need for looser policy later 
as growth slows. 

Even if one accepts the curve’s signaling value for the 
economy – essentially just admitting that that the Fed can 
influence the business cycle – extending the framework to 
the dollar has several conceptual limitations. One is timing: 
should the dollar depreciate when the curve steepens 
because current short rates are falling (bull steepening), or 
should it appreciate because short end rates will be higher in 
the future? Conversely, should the currency appreciate 
when the curve flattens because short rates are rising (bear 
flattening), or should it depreciate because of a looming 
economic downturn? Add in the possible curve twists of 
bull flattening (flatter curve but at lower rates) and bear 
steepening (steeper curve but at higher rates), and the 
intuition becomes fuzzy quite quickly. The other 
shortcoming is the cross-market element: currencies are 
relative prices so should move on rate spreads between 
countries, not on just rate levels in one country. One could 
always compare curve shapes between countries, but it isn’t 
so obvious that applying a conceptually weak framework 
across two countries should be more revelatory than 
focusing that lens on one market.

Empirically, there isn’t much support for this curve-
currency link. Over the floating rate era, the correlation 
between the USD index and the yield curve (proxied here 
by the 2s/10s spread) is close to zero but with significant 
variance across decades: in the 1970s and 1980s, the dollar 
strengthened as the curve steepened; in the early 1990s, the 
curve and dollar had almost no correlation; and in the late 
1990s and parts of the 2000s, the dollar has tended to 
strengthen as the curve flattened (chart 5). Patterns are just 
as hazy when examining the full range of curve moves – 
bull steepeners, bull flatteners, bear steepeners or bear 
flatteners – over various sample periods. Based on 
movements in 2s/5s (chart 6), the only consistent 
relationship across sample periods is that the dollar seems to 
like bull flatteners and hate bear steepeners. Based on 
2s/10s (chart 7), the dollar also seems to like bull flatteners 
but hate both bull steepeners (because of too much Fed 
easing?) and bear flatteners (because of disruptive Fed 
tightening?). Based on 10s/30s (chart 8), the only consistent 
relationship is that that dollar seems to dislike bear 
steepening (because of rising inflation risk?). 

With so little consistency over curve segment and sample 
period and such rickety conceptual underpinnings, one 
shouldn't be ashamed to de-emphasise the yield curve as an 
FX driver as we move through the next few years of rate 
normalization, especially since the Fed’s unconventional 
policies post-Lehman have distorted the curve’s usual 
directionality. Stay focused on US rates, of course, but 
more for these issues: how short-end US rates influence 
carry across all currencies; how long end rates influence 
unhedged duration flows into EM local markets; and how 
real interest rates affect the overall attractiveness of USD 
assets. How much 2s move relative to 5s, 10s and 30s 
seems a distant secondary issue. 

Next week: Flash PMIs, US and Aussie 
CPI, RBNZ, EM trade 

The Flash PMIs on Thursday will be an important release 
from the US, Euro area, Japan and China. 

The PMI aside, CPI (Tuesday) will be a very important US 
release next week in light of the upside surprises in this 
report in recent months (see Inflation surprises, credibility 
and the dollar published on July 14). In addition, existing 
home sales (Tuesday), new home sales (Thursday) and 
durable goods (Friday) will be important. There are no Fed 
speakers given the upcoming FOMC meeting on 30 July. 
Canada only has retail sales (Wednesday) which tends to 
deliver sharp surprises and could result in some market 
movement. 

Euro area’s important calendar is quite light and includes 
only consumer confidence (Wednesday) and the German 
IFO (Friday). UK’s calendar has more releases with 


Rightmove HPI (Monday), MPC minutes (Wednesday), 
retail sales (Thursday) and GDP (Friday). The Scandi 
calendar is light as well with only Sweden releasing 
employment (Thursday) and retail sales and trade (Friday). 
Finally, Switzerland releases money supply (Monday) and 
trade (Tuesday). 

Japan has trade (Thursday) and CPI (Friday). Australia's 
2Q CPI will be on Wednesday and will be very important. 
The 1Q number had printed below expectations, and we 
think that risks around the upcoming release are also 
skewed to the downside. New Zealand has trade 
(Thursday) and business confidence (Friday). China has no 
releases aside from the flash PMI. 

In EM Asia ex-China, Taiwan export orders will be 
important, as it is expected to show an improvement in 
response to developments in the US, China and Japan. In 
addition, Taiwan IP (Wednesday), Korea GDP (Thursday) 
and Singapore IP (Friday) will be of note. EMEA EM has 
Poland retail sales and South Africa CPI (Wednesday) and 
Turkey trade (Friday). In Latam, Brazil IPCA, Mexico 
retail sales (both Tuesday), Mexico economic activity index 
and CPI (Thursday), Brazil current account balance and 
Mexico trade (Friday) will be important. 

Two central banks meet this week: Hungary (Tuesday) 
and New Zealand (Thursday). The RBNZ should deliver a 
25bp hike but the accompanying statement could tilt dovish 
in a nod to the soft 2Q CPI print. The NBH is expected to 
cut rates by 10bp.

Macro Trade 
Recommendations 

. 
The divergence between hard activity and survey data 
continued in the US, keeping us cautious on USD 
longs for the time being despite our constructive 
medium-term view. Our preferred strategy is to be 
focused on relative value and conservative carry 
trades. 

. 
Sell AUD/NZD ahead of key event risk next week 
(RBNZ, Australia 2Q CPI). Valuations are also 
supportive of this trade. 

. 
Tactically unwind GBP longs vs. NOK. GBP no longer 
appears compellingly cheap on European crosses and 
we wait for better entry levels to re-initiate GBP longs. 

. 
Long PLN/RON still appears appealing; we 
recommend maintaining exposure. 

. 
Our favored carry trade is still short USD/CNY; 
decent China data is supportive of this trade. 
USD/PHP is still attractive ahead of BSP. 

. 
Closed trades: Unwind GBP/NOK in cash. 

. 
New trades: Sell AUD/NZD in cash. 

. 
Existing trades: Short 3-mo USD/CNY and USD/PHP 
NDF. Long USD/NOK and PLN/RON in cash. Short 
cable via a 2mo-4mo 1.6300 one-touch calendar 
spread. Long a 1Y EUR/CHF ATMF put 

July has brought with it an interesting set of market moves: 
10-year US yields declined 4bp to the lower end of their 1year 
range intra-week, even as market expectations for the 
Fed funds target rate actually increased to near the upper 
end of its 1-year range (3-month OIS rates 2-year forward 
are 13bp higher month-to-date). The dollar has ignored the 
rally in 10-year yields and strengthened against most 
currencies, nearly 0.6% higher on a trade-weighted basis 
MTD, but still looks too low given the level of US yield 
spread to the rest of the world and volatility (chart 1). 
However, US releases this week continue to highlight the 
discrepancy between hard data and survey data: while the 
Philly Fed and Empire Manufacturing surveys delivered 
strong outcomes, manufacturing output, total retail sales and 
housing starts were soft (Daily Economic Briefing, David 
Hensley, 18 July, 2014). In addition, Fed Chair Yellen 
maintained a dovish stance in her Congressional testimony 
this week. We continue to be of the opinion that hard data 
needs to provide more clarity on the recovery for the dollar 
rally to have legs and thus continue to recommend keeping 
our long USD positioning light. Our only USD long 


FX trade recommendations 

Trade recommendations in this section are mostly spot, for 
easier incorporation into the monthly Global Markets 
Outlook & Strategy (GMOS), which outlines J.P. Morgan’s 
flagship model portfolio across bonds, credit, equities, fx 
and commodities. Some directional option trades are 
included here as alternatives to cash position, and as a 
complement to relative value trades discussed in FX 
Derivatives section of this publication (p. 16). 

Current recommendations are marked to market at Friday 
afternoon London time. A complete inventory of closed 
trades is presented at the end of this section along with 
performance statistics such as success rates and average 
returns per trades.

outstanding currently is vs. NOK. Instead, our strategy is 
focused on relative value (short AUD/NZD, long 
PLN/RON) and select USD shorts vs. EM partially 
motivated by carry (short USD/CNY and USD/PHP). 

This week we recommend adding tactical shorts to 
AUD/NZD. NZD was the notable underperformer in G10 
this week (down 1.5% vs. USD) given a soft inflation print 
and an abysmal dairy auction (-9%, the largest 2-week 
decline since April 1). The 2Q NZ CPI printed in line with 
RBNZ’s forecast but was a touch below consensus. At 
0.3%q/q, it is still low by New Zealand standards and our 
economists note that given the extent to which food prices 
picked up in late 2Q, the outcome was a modest undershoot 
even relative to RBNZ’s expectations. Despite the benign 
print, our expectation is that the RBNZ is unlikely to deliver 
the dovish message the market might be looking for at its 
meeting next week and we still look for the target rate to be 
raised by 25bp. Meanwhile, Australia’s CPI also prints next 
week, the risks around which should be biased to the

downside in our view given benign partial data on prices 
already in hand and steady strength in the currency this 
year. In addition, the RBA's continued attempts to jawbone 
down the currency is also supportive of downside bias on 
AUD. In a press interview this week, RBA Governor 
Stevens reiterated his view that AUD appears quite high on 
multiple metrics and that investors are “underestimating the 
probability of a material decline at some point”. Finally, 
short AUD/NZD looks attractive from a valuation 
standpoint as well, with AUDNZD looking nearly 2.9% too 
high on our 2-year short-term fair value model (chart 2), a 
2.2 sigma mispricing making it one of the most mispriced 
pairs in our universe. 
We also recommend unwinding GBP longs and await 
better entry levels to reinitiate them. Our current GBP 
long vs. NOK was initiated three weeks ago when GBP was 
screening as one of the cheapest G10 currencies in our short 
term fair value models. That mispricing has since corrected 
versus nearly all other G10 European currencies and GBP 
now appears fair-to-rich on most European crosses (chart 3; 
note that GBP still appears cheap vs. CAD and JPY). While 
our view is still that there are not nearly enough rate hikes 
priced into interest rate markets (only a total of 75bp 
increase is currently priced in for 2015), neutral valuations, 
still-long spec positions in the currency and the lack of 
wage inflation pressures as evidenced in the otherwise 
strong labour market report this week prompts us to 
tactically unwind our overweight in GBP. And while we did 
get a very large high-side CPI print from the UK this week, 
it is not by itself enough to move the needle on BoE given 
that this was likely driven by temporary factors related to 
summer discounting issues and will likely be reversed in the 
next two months (UK: Upside June inflation surprise will 
mostly be temporary, Allan Monks, 15 July). 
Trades 
. Initiate tactical shorts in AUD/NZD 
There is key event risk in both currencies next week 
which makes us tactically bearish on AUD/NZD. The 
RBNZ should still deliver a rate hike and not be dovish, 
this week’s soft CPI print notwithstanding, while risks to 
Australia’s 2Q CPI report are biased to the downside. 
Valuations are supportive of the trade, with AUD/NZD 
nearly 2.2 sigma too high on our fair value models. 
. Sell AUD/NZD in cash at 1.082. Stop at 1.100. 
. Unwind longs in GBP vs. NOK 
As noted above, GBP no longer appears cheap on most 
European crosses including NOK based on our short term 
fair value models. In the absence of any wage inflation 
pressures and long spec positions, we find value in 
unwinding GBP longs vs. NOK at current levels. 
However, since our view is that there is still not enough

since our view is that there is still not enough BoE hikes 
priced into the rates market, we will be looking for more 
attractive entry levels to re-initiate GBP longs. 

. 
Unwind long in GBP/NOK in cash at 10.551. 
Marked at 0.8%. 


. 
SEK shorts were unwound/ stopped out 
We had been recommending SEK shorts ahead of the 
Riksbank meeting and in the wake of Norges Bank. 
However, Swedish CPI delivered a very strong upside 
surprise in June with the headline rising from -0.2% to 
+0.2% and CPIF from +0.4% to +0.8%. While we still 
think that EUR/SEK should head higher in the coming 
months given the Riksbank's stance (indeed, the minutes 
released this week were dovish and continued to highlight 
that the door remains open for another rate cut), we were 
stopped out long GBP/SEK and closed a long EUR/SEK 
position on July 10. 
. 
Long EUR/SEK in cash was unwound on July 10 
at a profit of 0.3%. 

. 
Long GBP/SEK in cash was stopped out on July 
10 at a loss of -1.4%. 

. 
Stay short NOK vs. USD 
This trade was initiated on July 3, a week during which 
we did not publish our regular FX Markets Weekly. At 
that point we had been bearish on NOK in the wake of the 
Norges Bank’s dovish forecast revisions, but had 
switched the recommended trade from EUR/NOK to 
USD/NOK thereby neutralising the portfolios’s overall 
implicit EUR/USD exposure. We are still bearish on 
NOK but acknowledge that a limited data calendar in the 
next week or so will keep the market quiet. However, we 
still recommend holding this trade in advance of the key 
upcoming releases in the US over the next two weeks, i.e. 
CPI and payrolls. 

. 
Stay long USD/NOK at 6.214. Marked at -0.6%. 

. 
Stay long PLN/RON in cash 
The motivations for this trade were diminishing risks in 
Poland on the political front, intervention to defend PLN, 
as well as the country balance of payments improvement 
(a resilient current account balance in the face of higher 
domestic demand; less concern on outflows from the 
country given ECB’s dovish stance). For Romania, we 
look for continued intervention to weaken the currency 
alongside further rate cuts. The risk to this trade that we 
would monitor actively is that geopolitical tensions 
around Russia escalate further, which would result in an 
underperformance of PLN vs. RON. 

. 
Stay long PLN/RON in cash at 1.070. Marked at 
1.3%. 


. 
Stay short 3-mo USD/PHP NDF 
We continue to look for a more hawkish direction of 
policy by the BSP as it is preemptive against inflation and 
thus stay short USD/PHP. Gradual domestic rate 
tightening should provide a better buffer on margin when 
the markets start to price in future Fed hikes fully. 
. 
Stay short 3-mo USD/PHP NDF at 43.526 on June 

20. Marked at +0.7%. 
. 
Stay short USD/CNY through a 3-m NDF 
Data releases from China in the past week have been 
strong with aggregate financing data solid suggesting 
continued policy accommodation on margin and June IP 
and 2Q GDP printing a touch above consensus 
expectations. In addition, USD/CNY fixings have been 
within a range thus far in July (albeit one wider than 
usual). We continue to think that risks are skewed for an 
eventual move lower in USD/CNY rather than a spike 
higher and thus continue to recommend this carry trade 
which still screens attractive from a risk-adjusted 
standpoint. 

. 
Sold a 3-mo USD/CNY NDF at 6.179 on June 6. 
Marked at 0.31%. 

. 
Hold a bearish cable one-touch calendar spread 
This trade was intended as a way to position for a rise in 
volatility in the lead-up to the Scottish referendum on 
September 18. Forward volatility has indeed risen but this 
effect has been overshadowed by rally in spot, hence the 
trade’s value has halved. We recommend holding on to 
this trade for now. 
. 
Sold a 2-mo/buy a 4-mo 1.63 GBP/USD digital put 
at net cost of 21%. Now worth 4.4%. 

. 
Hold 1Y ATMF EUR/CHF put 
The outlook is that with the ECB maintaining a dovish 
tone and activity data still strong in Switzerland, 
EUR/CHF should be well supported and drift towards 

1.21 in the next few quarters, a level at which implied 
vols should invert higher. As a result, we hold exposure 
to this trade. 
. 
Bought a 1Y ATMF EUR/CHF put (strike 1.2088) 
for 1.81% on March 14. Marked at 65bp.

We hold OW COP and UW CLP in the GBI-EM

. 
We hold MW BRL and MXN; we maintain the view 
USD/BRL in the 2.20-2.25 range as BCB is likely to 
step up intervention through a fastest pace of FX swap 
rollover would geopolitical risks linger 

The latest developments in Brazil support our hold long 
BRL/CLP recommendation, as a relative value play 
within the region, and staying UW CLP in the GBI-EM 
Model Portfolio. Following the disappointment in 
Brazilian activity data in recent weeks, JPMorgan 
economists have revised down growth estimates for 2014 to 
0.7%, with 1Q/2Q likely to have seen recessionary 
conditions of -0.4%/-1%, and removed 2015 rate hikes from 
the forecast (F. Akira, C. Fernandez). We have been 
flagging risks that the market would be biased to fade rate 
hikes priced in the curve, and the latest developments 
substantiate this and support the long local bonds call. 
Meanwhile, the latest election poll data from Datafolha 
suggest a tighter race, with Dilma leading by 4%-pts in a 
run-off simulation scenario versus 7%-pts in the last poll 
and 27% early this year. As we have suggested, indications 
that the election will be tighter suggests a higher likelihood 
of macroeconomic policy change from either winner and 
should support Brazilian assets. Last week, we 
recommended being long BRL/CLP and UW CLP generally 
with more emphasis on the CLP leg which was likely to 
depreciate on the back of BCCh easing. We stick with that 
call and see additional upside from the BRL leg as well now 
given current valuations.

We believe USD/BRL will continue to trade in a 2.20


2.25 range; hold long BRL/CLP. In our view, the high 
BRL carry, together with BCB intervention, is set to keep 
the currency rangebound in the short term. Despite risk-off 
on the back of geopolitical risks hurting Latin America 
currencies on flight to quality, we still expect USD/BRL to 
trade in the 2.20-2.25 range in the short term. The main 
support for the currency comes from both the global low-
volatility regime (note that, despite the latest events in 
Ukraine and Gaza, the EM 3-month implied volatility index 
was up only 0.25 vols to 6.15%, and remains close to 
historic lows) and BCB intervention. 
BCB is likely to step up the rollover pace to contain 
depreciation pressures if geopolitical risks linger. In the 
latest inflation report, BCB increased the official inflation 
projections for 2014 (to 6.4% from 6.2%) and 2015 (to 
6.0% from 5.5%). Of note, the official forecasts assume an 
FX rate at 2.25 for December 2014 (J.P. Morgan: 2.35) and 
a Selic rate at 11.0%. In this vein, we believe the FX rate 
remains a key anchor to expectations. Therefore, BCB will 
step up intervention if geopolitical risks linger, as the 
monetary authority has room to increase the FX swap 
rollover pace, thus offsetting depreciation pressures. At the 
current rollover pace, BCB would let around $2.4bn expire 
by the end of the month. Thus, the authority can increase 
the daily rollover by close to $250mn if need be, up to 
$590mn per day through the end of the month (at such a 
pace, BCB would roll over 100% of the FX swaps maturing 
August 1).

We maintain a neutral stance on MXN. The MXN 
performed relatively well in the last week, slipping only 
0.1% against the US dollar in the five days through 
Thursday, outperforming Latin America peers. In our view,

coincidental indicators (Exhibit 3), while it looks rich on 
other crosses: CAD/MXN (Z-score -0.9), AUD/MXN (Zscore

would the current risk off regime be short lived as be

We remain OW COP in the GBI-EM Model Portfolio. 

The COP has slipped 0.94% against the USD in the last two 
weeks (through Thursday), outperforming CLP and BRL 
but underperforming PEN and MXN. We have been OW 
COP since the JPMorgan index team announced the 
increase of Colombian rates’ weight in the GBI-GD 
benchmark, with the idea that the corresponding portfolio 
inflows to local fixed income on the back of the rebalance 
would cause temporary appreciation through the fourth 
quarter of the year. Despite the fact that the authorities have 
stepped up dollar purchases (BanRep to buy up to $2.0bn in 
3Q14, Treasury bought $181mn in June), coupled with 
verbal intervention, and while the market has re-priced 
downward the terminal rate of the tightening cycle, we 
stick to our view of portfolio inflows dominating and see 
further downside for USD/COP from current levels. 

Colombia portfolio inflows have been concentrated in 
the second half of the month, so we expect appreciation 
pressures for next week. In the last two months, May and 
June, portfolio inflows have been concentrated in the last 
two weeks of the month, particularly in the fourth week. 
Indeed, portfolio inflows averaged $1.35bn in the last two 
months, with a notable increase by the last week of the 
month (Exhibit 6). On average, 17% of the portfolio 
inflows have taken place in the first and second weeks, 
24% in the third, and 41% in the fourth week. We expect 
this pattern to repeat again in July; therefore, we remain 
OW COP.

We remain short CLP, as BCCh delivered a 25bp policy 
rate cut, but we see another cut in August a cumulative 
50bp of easing this year. Last week, Chile's central bank 
cut the policy rate 25bp to 3.75%, in line with our forecast. 
Most importantly, the easing bias was reinforced in the 
post-meeting statement, playing down inflation concerns as 
activity continues to disappoint. So far, our short CLP 
recommendation has played out, as the CLP has 
underperformed in EM space (barring the RUB sell-off on 
sanctions and geopolitical risks). We now see another cut 
of 25bp in August, while maintaining the call for a terminal 
rate of 3.25% by year-end. The high likelihood we attach to 
another policy cut in August keeps us UW CLP, despite the 
fact that our short-term model suggests that CLP is fairly 
priced to coincidental indicators (Exhibit 7). Indeed, we see 
high odds for USD/CLP to pierce the 568 resistance level 
(see Exhibit 8). We thus hold the recommendations we 
published last week, long USD/CLP and the long 
BRL/CLP, as BRL carry cheapens the short CLP leg 

Exhibit 5. USD/CLP approaching the 568 resistance, which we think 
will be pierced in the short term, remain UW CLP

. 
Deep OTM cross-yen puts are underpriced relative to 
typical left-tail moves in spot. EUR calls/EM puts are 
overvalued, while USD calls/EM puts are middle of 
the pack. Low premium risk-off option RVs to 
consider are a) cross-yen puts vs. USD/JPY puts and 
b) USD/EM calls vs. EUR/EM calls. 

. 
Cross-yen vol curves are steep in the 6M-1Y segment. 
Sell 6M6M FVAs in positive carry long vol constructs 
such as 1X2 FVA spreads, or use the rolldown to fund 
the premium of AUD puts/JPY calls. 

FX vols have not shown much sign of life in July so far, 
even though geopolitical goings-on gave front-end implieds 
some lift late in the week. It’s not all doom and gloom for 
gamma traders though, since non-G3 crosses are delivering 
enough by way of intra-day ranges to pay for theta bills 
(chart 1). As a result, YTD returns from outright short 
gamma and/or short gamma vs. long vega calendar 
strategies that had proven very successful in H1 have begun 
to inflect lower. Anecdotal accounts suggest that this is 
prompting a shift in vol investor interest towards curve 
flatteners instead. The underlying motivation is not difficult 
to grasp: long vol is really the only way to position from 
current levels, and vol curve flatteners represent a lower-
bleed way of assuming exposure to higher vols than outright 
longs. To be sure, our baseline expectation is for little to 
change on the vol front unless Fed communication takes a 
more hawkish turn at Jackson Hole, but it is difficult to 
argue against trades that benefit from a disruption of the 
ongoing complacency in risk without costing an arm and a 
leg. Since most questions from clients over the last two 
weeks have tended to center around this theme, we discuss 
two potential ways of addressing it: via relative value in 
low-delta options (buying underpriced puts in high-beta 
currencies against those in low-beta FX), and carry-efficient 
intra-surface option RVs that benefit asymmetrically from 
higher vol. 

Relative value in tail risk pricing in FX options 

At current bargain basement levels of FX vol, we examine 
how complacently left tail events are priced in FX options 
vis-à-vis the historical experience of underlying moves in 
episodes of market stress. The starting point of the analysis 
is to back out strikes of highly geared one touch options 

(e.g. 6M 10:1) across a large universe of currencies. We 
compare the spot-to-strike distances of such one-touches to 
the peak-to-trough moves in spot during the three most 
recent episodes of market stress – Greece spring 2010, 
EMU fall 2011 and taper spring 2013 (we use an average of 
the three readings). The ratio of the two is a rough measure

of how aggressively options are priced for a disruption of 
the prevailing calm in FX; higher the number, more 
expensive the option wings. Chart 2 ranks currencies in 
order of this metric, takeaways are as follows: 

. 
Yen crosses are clearly cheap as risk-off plays. Beyond 
the universal decline in risk premia, yen cross vols have 
come in for special punishment over the last year due to 
vega supply from retail structured notes. Global sales of 
retail structured products are running at an above-par 
pace in 2014 vs. the last two years, of which Asia Pacific 
FX product sales has been an important component. This 
is consistent with anecdotal reports of heavy back-end 
(2Y-5Y) vol selling in high-beta yen crosses usually 
associated with Uridashi structures. The cross-yen option 
market has also not recovered the correlation distorting 
impact of last year’s yen bear-trend. Traditionally low 
(and sometimes even negative) correlations between a 
funding currency like JPY and high-yielders such as 
AUD, NZD or EMs have regime-shifted higher since the 
Abe trade began in late 2012, in part due to the yen’s 
resilience to stress as the market perceived a soft BoJ 
floor under USD/JPY, and partially as a result of 
coincident idiosyncratic weakness in many currencies 
(rate cuts in Australia, vulnerabilities in C/A deficit EMs 
etc). Obviously, higher yen-FX correlations lead to lower 
cross-vols. The upshot is that deep OTM cross-yen puts 
that usually trade at a substantial premium over realized 
distress moves in spot now trade at par with or even 
below the latter (the ratio in chart 2 is even less than 1 for 
CHF/JPY, AUD/JPY, EUR/JPY and CAD/JPY) and 
pack-in little or no risk premium over and above those 
historical tail realizations. 

. 
More than outright cross-yen cheapness, we are interested 
in their relative ranking vis-à-vis USD/JPY. USD/JPY is 
distinctly middle of the pack on chart 2, hence long 
cross-yen puts vs. short USD/JPY puts as a risk-off 
RV theme is very much on. This is not a new idea by 
any stretch; we advocated AUD/JPY vs. USD/JPY put 
switches in our year-ahead 2014 outlook as a low 
premium yen hedge. Compared to outright USD puts/JPY 
calls that bleed steadily over time, their edge lies in 
imparting empirical convexity to risk-off returns (chart 
3). At a time when uncertainty around the longevity of 
the current vol lull dissuades investors from forking out 
too much cash to buy options outright, such spreads 
provide an alternative for assuming defensive exposure 
without expending much premium. 

. 
Contrast the complacency of left-tail pricing in yen-
crosses with that in EUR-crosses, where 2X-3X of the 
typical distress moves in spot are required to trigger 10:1 
one-touch payouts. For EUR/EM crosses, this is 
somewhat understandable in light of trepidation around 


Chart 3. Long cross-yen puts vs. short USD/JPY puts has proven to 
be a source of asymmetric risk-off alpha

the EM leg – the likes of RUB, TRY and BRL ought to 
command substantial vol premia for geopolitical and/or 
BOP risks. Less obvious is why USD-pairs of those same 
EM currencies trade with tighter risk premia than their 
EUR-counterparts, at a time when an impending turn in 
the US rate cycle ought to inject greater volatility into the 
former. Chart 4 shows that the USD-vs.EUR-vol RV in 
EM currencies is near a multi-year extreme, and that 
USD-vols have demonstrated a consistent tendency of 
outperforming in risk-off outbreaks. Hence this class of 
spread trades is also worth keeping on the radar as a 
source of low premium crisis-alpha as we move closer to 
a potential turn in US rates over the summer.

Cross-yen vol curves steep: use curve slide to 
fund defensive trades 

In addition to relatively cheap tail pricing, the other 
distortion in cross-yen vols is the pronounced slope of 
1Y-6M term structures. Were abysmally low entry levels 
not an issue, 6M6M forward volatility (FVAs) in the likes 
of AUD/JPY, EUR/JPY and CAD/JPY would have 
qualified as automatic shorts given the 1.5-2.0 vols of slide 
they offer along the curve into 6M ATM vols (chart 5). The 
problem of course is that grab for vol curve carry cannot 
ignore the inconvenient issue of record-low vol levels. Sure, 
there exists a preference for short FVA trades in certain 
pairs over others; for instance, EUR/JPY and USD/JPY 
seem safer sells to us despite their slightly lower carry 
pickup vis-a-vis a steeper curve such as NZD/JPY, given 
depressed recent realized volatility, the existence of a soft 
BOJ cap on yen (especially true for USD/JPY around 100) 
and most importantly, the relatively inert/risk-insensitive 
nature of the non-yen currencies in question (EUR 
becalmed by near zero ECB rates, USD strength in the 
event of a hawkish Fed unlikely to be beneficial for 
USD/JPY vega given inverse spot-vol correlation) – a claim 
that is hard to make for a high-beta carry currency like NZD 
with still-substantial spec length (IMMs). Nonetheless, the 
dilemma of poor vol valuations continues to rankle. 

In our minds, the way to resolve this conundrum is to use 
the rolldown on offer in order to fund defensive trades. One 
example of this class of trades are 1X2 FVA spreads that 
we have discussed in the past (e.g. here) – selling 1X vega 
of rapidly sliding 6M6M FVAs against buying 2X vega of 
1Y6M FVAs on relatively flatter segments of vol curves, 
and creating positive carry, long vol exposure. Among the 
more liquid pairs in G10, AUD/USD, AUD/JPY, 
NZD/JPY, GBP/USD and USD/CHF currently screen as 
good candidates for such trades (table 1). For a more 
market-neutral, pure alpha flavor, consider pairing these 
1X2 FVA spreads (preferably in higher-beta pairs such as 
AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY) against shorts in USD/JPY and 
EUR/JPY forward vols discussed above. Another iteration 
of a similar principle is to sell FVAs on steep curves – say 
in AUD/JPY – in conjunction with buying cheap 
AUD/JPY puts (or even AUD/JPY – USD/JPY put 
switches discussed in the previous section). Constructed in 
fully-funded fashion i.e. with notionals sized to exactly 
offset the premium of the vanilla option with the full-life 
static rolldown on the FVA, the projected P/L profile of the 
resulting combination from current entry levels is highly 
asymmetric, if the historical joint distribution of changes in 
spot and vol is any guide to future price action (chart 6). 
This is a viable line of thinking in high-skew currency pairs 
where vol returns are well-correlated to directional returns, 
such that it is possible to trade RV between them if there is 
a substantial risk premium or carry differential to monetize.

Technical Strategy 


. 
EUR – Looking vulnerable but keeping the start 
window for an intermediate recovery open for now 

. 
Scandies – Intermediate recoveries are providing 
fresh selling opportunities within a broad downtrend 

. 
GBP – Although looking stretched, the general up-
trend has room to go before hitting key-resistance 

. 
CEEMEA FX – The down risks have increased via the 
intensification of the Ukrainian crisis 

. 
Stay long USD/JPY, USD/SEK, USD/NOK, 
EUR/AUD, EUR/NZD, USD/CZK, USD/CLP, 
MXN/CLP & short CAD/MXN, NZD/USD 

EUR remains vulnerable but key-support levels 
keep the door open for a bounce 

The idea of having already completed the first bear market 
impulse in EUR/USD close to key-support at 1.3477/68 
(2014 low/monthly trend) is currently being reviewed. As 
long as it is defended though, we see the start window for a 
broader 2nd or B-wave rally to 1.3877 (minor 76.4 %) as 
open. For such a rebound to be supported and in order to 
confirm the wave 1 or wave A low at 1.3503, it however 
takes breaks above 1.3565/75 (minor 38.2 %/pivot) and 
above 1.3678 (200 DMA). Close to 1.3877 we'd then see 
the perfect risk-reward given to establish a strategic EUR 
short positions. Only a decisive break above the latter 
would re-open extended recovery potential to the big T-
junction at 1.4259 (76.4 % on higher scale). A break and 
weekly close below 1.3468 would on the other hand call for 
a straight extension towards former lows at 1.3295 (Nov. 
13) and at 1.3104 (Sept. 13). As for EUR/JPY we only see 
limited recovery potential to 139.30/31 (pivot/minor 38.2 
%) within an intact downtrend towards at least 135.55 
(minor 38.2 %) and 134.36 (C = A). Below the latter we'd 
even see a decline into the 128.10 (38.2 % on higher scale) 
handle. In terms of EUR/CHF we are awaiting a range 
breakout between 1.2138/22 (minor 76.4 %/pivot) and 
1.2215/24 (minor 76.4 %/daily trend) to either challenge 
1.2000/1.1974 (SNB floor/pivot) or 1.2327 (int. 76.4 %). 

The big picture for Scandies remains negative, sell 
recoveries 

Despite the latest recovery attempts, particularly in NOK, 
we don’t see a change in the generally weak outlook for 
Scandies. The failure to settle above the next decisive T-
junctions at 6.2045 in USD/NOK and at 6.8482 (minor 76.4 
%) in USD/SEK so far however keeps the door open for 
another corrective leg down to minor 38.2 % retracements 
at 6.1316 in USD/NOK and to 6.7170 in USD/SEK. 


Chart 1: EUR/USD – Daily Chart: Make or break at key-support 
between 1.3511 and 1.3477/68! 


Chart 2: USD/SEK – Weekly Chart: The big picture suggests that we 
are at least going to test key-Fib.-resistance at 7.0789 


Above these key-supports though, the next intermediate up-
targets at 6.3719/6.3820 (76.4 % on higher scale/c = a) in 
USD/NOK and at 6.9032 (c = a) as well as 7.0789 (76.4 % 
on higher scale) in USD/SEK remain in focus next. In terms 
of EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK we also see additional upside 
potential which would however only open up once the key-
resistance barriers at 9.3653 (int. 38.2 %) in EUR/SEK is 
broken decisively. Below, setbacks can stretch back to int. 

38.2 % retracements at 8.9363 in EUR/SEK and at 8.0619 
in ERU/NOK without reversing the broader up-trends. 
The broader GBP up-trend can extend further 
before the next resistance barrier is reached 

With the decisive break above key-pivotal resistance at 
1.7044/49 (2009 high/2005 low) in Cable last month, the 
market shook off the immediate setback risk and opened 
additional upside potential towards the next higher 
resistance barriers at 1.7332 (50 %/monthly Ichimokulagging) 
and at 1.7768 (C = A). Only a decisive hourly 
close below 1.7003 (minor 38.2 %, i.e. below 1.6980) 
would start weakening this bullish outlook in favor of a

broader setback to 1.6394 (int. 38.2 % on higher scale) if 
not to 1.6185 (weekly breakout line). The same applies for 
GBP/JPY where the upside remains open for an extension 
towards 183.98 and 185.01 (50 %/monthly Ichimokulagging) 
as long as 172.38/02 (pivot/daily trend) is 
defended. A daily close (10pm CET) though would open 
the way for a deeper setback to 164.58/163.88 (int. 38.2 
%/pivot) if not to 153.77/19 (int. 38.2 % on higher scales). 

Looking at the big picture for EUR/GBP above, we also see 
an intact up-trend for GBP with its focus on the next Key-
supports at 0.7755/44 (2012 low/50 %) and at 0.7492/86 
(weekly trend/C = A). An intermediate bounce could be 
launched anytime though and would have to clear the last 
intra-day high at 0.7982 to indicate that we are dealing with 
a recovery of higher scale to key-T-junctions at 0.8082 
(minor 38.2 %) if not to 0.8219/26 (Weekly trend/int. 38.2 
% on higher scale). It would take a decisive break above the 
latter though indicate a reversal of the long-term downtrend. 

The big picture remains negative for CEEMEA FX 
as no reversal signal is apparent yet 

Looking across CEEMEA FX we still see a high likelihood 
that the long-term downtrends are incomplete. This applies 
in particular for USD/RUB where the intensification of the 
Ukrainian crisis has increased the pressure on RUB 
significantly. To confirm a 5th wave advance towards 37.91 
or 38.21/52 (Fib.-projections) it however takes breaks 
above 36.076/320 (int. 76.4 %/pivot). We see similar setups 
in USD/TRY and in USD/PLN where it would take breaks 
above key-resistance at 2.1635/2.1717 (pivots) and at 
3.0779 (pivot) to receive first indications that a bottom 
might be in place. Additional hints that CEEMEA FX has 
resumed its downtrends would be given via breaks above 
4.1649 (daily trend) in EUR/PLN, above 2.9328/2.9537 
(minor 38.2 %/pivot) in EUR/TRY and above 
14.7676/14.8018 (daily Ichimoku-lagging/pivot) in 
EUR/ZAR. Former highs marked at the start of the year can 

Chart 3: EUR/GBP– Weekly Chart: A test of 0.7755/44 and an 
extension to 0.7486 remains the most likely scenario 

Chart 4: USD/RUB – Daily Chart: The resumption of the long-term 
up-trend is indicated but not confirmed yet 

be seen as minimum targets only in the EUR pairs, whereas 
USD/PLN and USD/ZAR could even challenge former 
highs from 2008. Watch 3.481/2 (daily trends) in USD/ILS 
as a break above would also signal a bottom in place.

Research Note 

Inflation surprises, credibility 
and the dollar: Examples from 
previous US inflation upturns 

. 
The next few weeks deliver four key releases for 
assessing the evolving US inflation outlook and its 
impact on markets: CPI on July 22, the quarterly 
employment cost index on July 31, and the PCE 
deflator plus average hourly earnings on August 1. 

. 
It is already apparent that US inflation bottomed this 
spring on CPI and PCE measures but remains at very 
low levels of around 2%, a pattern the Fed Chair 
characterises as "noisy". Perhaps less obvious is that 
most CPI releases over the past three months have 
surprised to the upside; that forecast errors tend to be 
directional with actual inflation; and that the 
interaction of these surprises with Fed policy can be 
quite influential on the dollar. 

. 
The late 1990s provides an example of how well the 
dollar responds to real rates that overcompensate for 
inflation surprises. The 2004-06 cycle highlights the 
opposite – the damage to a currency when real rates 
lag inflation surprises for too long. 

. 
Spring 2014 is starting to look quite like 2004, with 
real rates declining as inflation comes in higher than 
expected. It would be churlish to call this difference a 
credibility deficit since the Fed has a dual 
inflation/employment mandate and because it is still 
early days in the US interest rate cycle. But the recent 
trend in inflation surprises viewed against the level of 
real rates and the Fed's overall policy stance are a 
reminder of what flimsy ground the dollar sits on this 
summer unless the Fed’s tone shifts soon. 

Four reports over two weeks 

The next few weeks deliver four key releases for assessing 
the evolving US inflation outlook and its impact on 
markets: CPI on July 22, the quarterly employment cost 
index on July 31, and the PCE deflator plus average hourly 
earnings on August 1. It is already apparent that US 
inflation bottomed this spring on CPI and PCE measures 
but remains at very low levels of around 2%, a pattern the 
Fed Chair characterises as "noisy”. Perhaps less obvious is 
that most CPI releases over the past three months have 
surprised to the upside; that forecast errors tend to be 
directional with actual inflation (meaning upside surprises 
as inflation rises and downside ones as it falls – chart 1);

and that the interaction of these surprises with Fed policy 
can be quite influential on the dollar. The following charts 
provide a few examples with reference to the inflation 
upturns and subsequent Fed tightening cycles of the late 
1990s and mid 2000s. The current cycle is looking more 
like the latter than the former, though it is very early days. 

What’s credible? 

Charts 2 and 3 provide a long time series of the trade-
weighted dollar to highlight a point we have made 
before: that inflation isn't inherently good or bad for the 
dollar or any other currency; what matters is the real interest 
rate environment created by central bank policy in the 
context of that inflation cycle (see also Global inflation's 
bottoming --how should currencies respond? in the June 27

edition of FX Markets Weekly.) Hence, there is an 
inconsistent long-term relationship between the dollar and 
actual inflation or inflation expectations (R2 of 0.19 in chart 
2), but a firmer correlation between real yields and the 
currency (R2 of 0.6 in chart 3).1 

When central banks tighten before inflation rises or when 
they tighten by more than inflation surprises to the upside, 
real yields tend to increase and the currency appreciates. 
When real rates and the currency move before policy rates 
shift higher, many would say the central bank must have 
some of that fuzzy concept called credibility: markets 
discount a stable outcome, which the central bank simply 
validates over a tightening cycle. Of course central banks 
have different mandates (only inflation for many, inflation 
and employment for the Fed), so definitions and measures 
of credibility should vary by country. Leaving aside the 
value judgments, it is simply fact that the Fed’s ability to 
foster high or rising real rates has been helpful to the 
currency, whether by design or by accident. 

The recent historical record: 1999 & 2004 

The next several charts provide a few examples of a 
possible credibility effect on the dollar during inflation 
upswings around Fed tightening cycles. The sample 
period is limited to two episodes – Fed hikes from mid1999 
to early-2000, and from mid-2004 to mid-2006 – 
because our time series of monthly inflation surprises could 
only be constructed back to 1997. Also due to data 
constraints, this analysis is confined to consensus forecast 
errors around CPI inflation rather than extended to the PCE 
deflator, ECI or average earnings, since those surprise series 
could only be constructed for a five to ten year sample. 

In the late 1990s following the Asian Crisis, US inflation 
began trending higher from a rate of about 1.5% in late 
1998 to 3.8% by spring 2000. When the CPI upswing began, 
US real rates were already reasonably high at 3.5% (chart 4), 
since the Fed had hiked 300bp in 1994 and only partially 
unwound those rate rises in 1995 (due to a US slowdown) 
and 1998 (due to Russia’s default/LTCM’s collapse). 
Although inflation trended higher for two years, that 
process didn't surprise the consensus on average: from fall 
1998 to early 2000, monthly CPI reports surprised to the 
upside three times, surprised to the downside eight times 
and met expectations seven times. And even though 

1 Real yield spreads to the rest of the world should be used in chart 
2, but given limited data limitations and the fact that most spreads 
tend to be directional with US rates, only US rates are used in this 
analysis as a proxy for cross-market spreads.

cumulative inflation surprises over that period amounted to 
about -0.5%, Fed tightening contributed to a cumulative rise 
in real yields of about +0.6% (chart 5). Hence the moniker 
of a Goldilocks Economy coined at that time, a label which

well described the confluence of strong growth, stable 
inflation expectations, high real yields and a firm currency. 
(The tag line ignored, however, the stock market bubble and 
overleveraged US corporate sector which also defined that 
era.) 

The 2004 inflation upswing played out quite differently. 
From a low of 1.7% in spring 2004, CPI inflation rose to 
4.7% by fall 2006. Real rates were already at historic lows 
of about 1.4% at the beginning of that inflation upturn and 
failed to rise meaningfully until over a year into the Fed 
tightening cycle (chart 6). The reason was that most 
monthly inflation surprises were upside ones, yet the Fed 
persisted with the most measured tightening cycle in its 
history of 25bp per meeting for two years. Real rates 
therefore lagged inflation surprises until the Fed had 
completed its tightening cycle in 2006 (chart 7). By then not 
even higher real yields could support the currency, however, 
since the US current account deficit had widened to a record 
6% of GDP at that time. 

2014: more like 2004 than 1999, but it's 
still early days 

The backdrop for the 2014 inflation upturn and 2015 
Fed tightening looks more like 2004 than 1999. At 0.2%, 
US 10-yr real rates are not at historic lows – that distinction 
belongs to the pre-taper tantrum levels of -0.9% reached in 
early 2013 (chart 3) – yet they are still trivial. Those rates 
would probably have guaranteed a dollar downtrend over 
the past year were it not for a few offsets, like recurring 
optimism that the US economy has turned decisively; 
easing from the Bank of Japan and ECB; decent imbalances 
in several, significant emerging markets; and conversely a 
much lower US current account deficit (2.4% of GDP). 

But since inflation bottomed in March, monthly CPI reports 
have surprised to the upside twice (releases in April and 
June) and generated a cumulative overshoot of 0.3% versus 
consensus forecasts. That’s not much, but since various 
factors have suppressed long-end rates – the Fed Chair's 
dovishness, the debate over the Fed's terminal rate, a 
mediocre Q2 US rebound – real yields have declined. As a 
consequence, the gap between accumulated inflation 
surprises and changes in real rates almost matches some of 
the extremes of the 2004-2006 Fed cycles (charts 7 and 8). 
It would be churlish to call this difference a credibility 
deficit, since the Fed has a dual inflation/employment 
mandate and because it is still early days in the US interest 
rate cycle. But the recent trend in inflation surprises viewed 
against the level of real rates and the Fed's overall policy 
stance are a reminder of what flimsy ground the dollar sits 
on this summer unless the Fed’s tone shifts soon.

Easy money stays for a long time.

Rotate risk from over-owned and -valued 
… to better valued and less owned risk assets. 
Credit OWs are now small, and exposure is 
moved to equity, EM and commodity roll. 
OW EM across asset classes 
Relative macro momentum is switching to EM. 
EM growth expectations are stabilizing while 
those in DM have come down badly. Investors 
seem UW EM, while it offers better value. OW 
EM across bonds, FX, credit and equities. 
Avoid and hedge what is suspect 
Our UWs are not just based on value and macro 
momentum but also on what seems uncertain, 
coming from event risk, such as the Middle East 
and China, or from the unexplained (fall in U-rate 
and Q1 GDP). Hedges include oil futures, UW US 
FI vs EU, UW US equity vs EM.

Past half-time in the global business cycle 
June marks the 5th anniversary of the recovery. 
Working hypothesis is an 8-year recovery. That 
keeps equity rally on track, but makes the credit 
rally mature.
