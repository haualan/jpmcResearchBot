US Equity Strategy FLASH 

Stay bullish. Favor high-FCF yield and also 
Healthcare, Technology and Financials. 

The S&P 500 is now up nearly 2% YTD and we remain confident that the 
S&P 500 will reach at least 2075 by Year-End 2014 (based on 15.7x '15E EPS 
of $132). Leadership YTD has been Cyclical (after a bumpy start) with 
Airlines (+27% YTD), Gaming (+19%), Distributors (+19%), Tires (+17%) 
and Construction Materials (+17%) among the top industries. We continue 
to believe that 2014 will look a lot like 2013, favoring Cyclicals (Financials, 
Healthcare and Technology as our top picks, acknowledging Healthcare is 
not a Cyclical, but has cyclical tailwinds). Equally important to sector 
allocation is "style tilt". 

. 
2014 YTD, “flight to quality” styles have outperformed, such as 
“Growth” and “High-Div yield”. We have listed the comparative price 
performance of 6 different styles on Figure 4 and Figure 5. As highlighted 
below, two of the best performing style factors (among these pairs) are 
“Growth” and “High-dividend yield”— they are up 2.6% and 2.1% YTD, 
respectively (outperforming the S&P 500 by 104bp and by 56bp ). This 
reflects a “quality bias” among investors, given growth concerns (sluggish 
data, cold weather, etc.). Typically, Growth outperforms Value in a sluggish 
economic environment (when growth is scarce) and the softish economic 
data likely is the driver for this. However, as we noted in our report two 
weeks ago, there are reasons to expect Cyclicals to meaningfully 
outperform—which in turn, favors Value over Growth, and Low Momentum 
over High Momentum. We do not believe this is necessarily sustainable and 
most notably, because the valuation differentials are not justified. 

. 
High-FCF yield and also Low-priced stocks are very attractively valued. 

On Figure 8, we highlight how many standard deviations the P/E differential 
represents currently (the z-score). The higher the z-score, the more unusual 
the valuation gap. As shown on Figure 8, the largest differential in P/E 
today is between High FCF yield vs High Div yield (high FCF stocks are 
unusually inexpensive) and High-priced vs low-priced stocks. The P/E 
differential of High FCF yield vs High Div yield is 1.82 standard deviations 
and High vs low-price stocks is 1.31 standard deviations. We believe the 
large differential in valuation for these styles reflects, again, the flight to 
quality bias of investors, given the softish economic data. We do not believe 
this gap is justified and hence, we see these as particularly attractive. 

. 
Since early February, Cyclicals and higher-beta have also begun to 
outperform, suggesting the shift away from the “flight to safety bias”. 

In other words, we see a broadening of performance, commensurate with an 
anticipated improvement in economic visibility. 

MARKET STRATEGY: Stay bullish. We continue to be bullish for 2014 
and have highlighted the most attractive names for each style factor we favor 
(Figure 12, Figure 16, Figure 20, Figure 25 and Figure 29).

#1: YTD Price Performance of Styles. Flight to quality bias YTD. 

We have listed the comparative price performance of 6 different styles on Figure 4 and Figure 5. As highlighted below, among 
the best performing style factors (of these pairs) are “Growth” and “High-dividend yield”— they are up by 2.6% and 2.1% YTD 
respectively (outperforming the S&P 500 by 104bp and 56bp) On Figure 5, we compare the performance differential between the 
style pairs: 

. 
The outperformance of certain style factors YTD: given the rocky start in January, investors seem to have a “quality bias” in 
their preferences—this is reflected in the outperformance of “Growth over Value”, “High Momentum over Low Momentum” 
and “High Price vs Low Price.” In fact, those 3 represent the largest variances in performance YTD. We do not believe this is 
necessarily sustainable, most notably, because the valuation differentials are not justified. 

. 
Why does this reflect a quality/flight to safety bias? Typically, Growth outperforms Value in a sluggish economic 
environment (when growth is scarce) and the softish economic data likely is the driver for this. However, as we noted in our 
report two weeks ago (see "3 Reasons Cyclicals...", dated 2/21), there are reasons to expect Cyclicals to meaningfully 
outperform, which in turn, favors value over growth, and low momentum over high momentum.

#2: Comparative valuation: High FCF yield and also Low-priced 
stocks unusually inexpensive… 

Moving away from price performance, and instead focusing on valuation, we can get a sense for the risk/reward of various styles. 
On Figure 8, we highlight how many standard deviations the P/E differential represents currently (the z-score). The higher the z-
score, the more unusual the valuation gap: 

. 
As shown on Figure 8, the largest differential in P/E today is between High FCF yield vs High Div yield (high FCF stocks 
are unusually inexpensive) and High-priced vs Low-priced stocks. The P/E differential of High FCF yield vs High Div yield 
is 1.82 standard deviations and High vs low-price stocks is 1.31 standard deviations. 

. 
We believe the large differential in valuation for these styles reflects, again, the flight to quality bias of investors, given the 
softish economic data. We do not believe this gap is justified and hence, we see these are particularly attractive.

#3: Curious outlier: why are “low priced” stocks so cheap? 

We found a particularly sizable gap developing between the valuation of “low priced” stocks compared to “high priced”—with 
“high priced” stocks becoming unusually expensive. 

. 
In 2013 low-priced stocks outperformed high-priced stocks by 465bp, the first time since 2009. We believe that this 
outperformance of low-priced stocks will hold through the rest of 2014 for the rationale discussed below. 

. 
As shown on Figure 9 below, low priced stocks trade at a 1.73 standard deviation discount to high-priced stocks, which is one 
of the highest z-scores in more than a decade. In fact, as a later chart shows (Figure 11), the P/E discount has been widening 
for the past 5 years. 

Why this is happening is not obvious to us. One possibility is the quality bias of investors—that is, their desire to stay on the 
“race track” for the past five years, and as a consequence, have tended to view low-priced stocks as riskier.

That said, this does strike us as a potentially curious outperformance strategy. That is, we think investors should consider 
focusing on “low priced” and reasonably priced stocks.

We have identified a list of 21 "Low Price" stocks (see Figure 12) using the following criteria: 


. 
Stock price less than $25.00 (lowest quartile); 
. 
Market cap above $3 billion; 
. 
OW rated by J.P. Morgan analysts; 
. 
Positive upside to JPM price targets. 
On average, these 21 names have a 20% upside to JPM price targets, a 20.2x 2014 P/E and a 3.06x P/B. The tickers are SYMC,

#4: High FCF yield still is a better investment than High Div 
yield… 

High FCF yield outperformed the market by 1329bp in 2013, following another year of strong outperformance in 2012. 

. 
We expect "high FCF yield" to continue outperforming through 2014, which would mark its third year of outperformance. 

. 
It is more than a valuation argument (although as shown on Figure 13, High FCF yield remains startlingly cheap vs. high-
dividends at almost a 3x discount), as we believe that free cash flow is a better way to measure a quality investment, as it 
implies both the potential for dividend growth as well as financial flexibility.

#5: We also favor “heavily shorted” stocks and expect them to 
again outperform “less shorted” 

YTD, "heavily shorted" stocks have outperformed "less shorted" stocks by 57bps, which is a continuation of 2013's trend. In 
2013, “heavily shorted” stocks outperformed “less shorted” by 198bp, reversing a two-year streak as shown on Figure 17 below. 
We believe there are several reasons for this, but two factors stand out to us: 

. 
The equity market broadened in 2013 (allowing more stocks to outperform), causing the short-selling win ratio to fall; 

. 
Anecdotally, we found many short ideas crowded, as evidenced by some stocks seeing a sizable portion of its float sold short.

#6: As “momentum” is not expensive, we see it outperforming 
again in 2014, but we also see incremental opportunity in 
“momentum laggards”… 

In 2013, “high momentum” stocks (top quartile trading above their 200-day moving average) were one of the single best styles, 
outperforming the S&P 500 by 660bp and “low momentum” stocks by 1098bp, while also outperforming “low momentum” 
stocks in 2012 by 438bp (see Figure 21). This trend continues in 2014, with “high momentum” stocks outperforming “low 
momentum” stocks by 91bp YTD.

With a forward P/E of 18x, the top quartile of momentum stocks are not overly expensive. Moreover, as shown on Figure 21, 
high momentum has outperformed 7 of the last 9 years. Hence, we see favorable risk/reward; 

. 
On the margin, we think there is room for “momentum laggards” to surprise in 2014 for two reasons: (i) given we are entering 
the 6th year of the bull market, we believe investors will begin to look at those industries that have trailed. On Figure 24 below

we have highlighted 29 such industries that have lagged the S&P since both the previous top and the bottom of the market; (ii) 
the relative P/E discount of “low momentum” vs. “high momentum” is 0.90 standard deviations (based on z-scores). This is 
one of the larger discounts and suggests the potential for low momentum to re-rate (see Figure 23).

Who are the multi-year momentum laggards? 

On Figure 24 below, we highlight the industries that have both underperformed the S&P 500 since the market bottom in March 
2009 and the previous market top in October 2007. 

These groups are not “cheap” overall, with a forward P/E of 21.7x, so we would not argue purely on valuation that this list will 
broadly perform. Rather, notice how cyclically sensitive this list of industries is. This makes us believe that a broadening 
recovery will boost revenue visibility and hence, the potential for an earnings surprise at many of the momentum laggards.

#7: As economic momentum improves, Value to outperform 
Growth… 

Growth ended its 6 year winning streak end in 2013. As shown on Figure 26, Growth underperformed Value by 315bp in 2013 
after a very impressive streak of outperformance (2007-2012). Although Growth has been showing stronger performance in the 
early weeks of 2014, our expectation for Value to continue outperforming in 2014 comes down to the following framework: 

. 
We anticipate GDP growth to broaden in 2014 and this implies that growth will be less scarce in terms of companies achieving 
better revenue profiles. Hence, investors will likely be less willing to chase traditional growth stocks and “unit growth” 
stories; 

. 
After reaching its widest spread in nearly a decade in July 2012 (see Figure 28), we believe the P/E differential between 
“Growth” and “Value” is likely to narrow (Figure 28 measures it by z-score). Consider that the average “growth” stock trades 
at nearly 19x today while the average value stock is 14x.

The points we made above are reinforced by looking at the 10-year time series below. As shown, the P/E differentials between 
“Growth” and “Value” have been widening since 2009 and the z-score (measuring the # of standard deviations) is still wide, 
favoring Value.

#8: Cyclicals should outperform several years, similar to the 
90s…Large-cap Technology is a steal 

We still favor Cyclicals over Defensives, primarily for fundamental reasons. That is, with economic growth expected to 
accelerate, it makes sense to be leveraged to companies with greater economic sensitivity, hence Cyclical stocks. 

. 
Outperformance of Cyclicals began in mid-2013 and as shown on Figure 30 below, outperformed Defensives by 1272bp in 
2013 (relative returns). Despite the weaker start in 2014, underperforming Defensives by 90bps YTD, we believe that 
Cyclicals should start leading (see “3 Reasons Cyclicals should start…”, dated 2/21/14) 

. 
The most attractive Cyclical sector, in our view, is Technology—in particular, large-cap/mega-cap Technology stocks. 
Technology is one of the least expensive groups (on a relative P/E basis, see Figure 31) and among the least liked groups.

Large-cap Technology may be the most attractive on a P/E-basis and is the least consensus group… 

We have compiled two statistics below in Figures 31 and 32: the long-term P/E of the 10 sectors and the “Street Mean Rating” 
(Analyst consensus views). 

. 
Cyclicals are very attractive on a CAPE-basis (cyclically adjusted P/E), when comparing the current CAPE to the 35-year 
average (see Figure 31). More specifically, Financials, Energy, and Technology are major outliers as they appear to be the 
cheapest. These three sectors trade at nearly 1.0 standard deviation or more from their long-term average.

. 
As for where analysts are most or least bullish, take a look at Figure 32. Most sectors have analyst “Street Mean Ratings” 
above long-term average. The two exceptions are Technology and Telecom Services. In other words, those two sectors are 
the least “consensus” with fewest buy ratings (relative). 

. 
Of the Cyclical sectors, we think the best opportunities are in Large-cap Technology. The sector has underperformed for two 
years in a row and trades attractively (as noted above). Moreover, it is heavily levered to a rise in capex (approximately 50% 
of capex is Technology spend) and particularly levered to growth in the Financials sector.

Macro at a Glance 
Economic Highlights 
Initial claims fall to 323,000 
Initial jobless claims for the week ending March 1st decreased 26k to 323k after a modest jump the week prior. It has been volatile 
in recent weeks, as it is difficult to adjust for the recent holidays. The four-week moving average remains steady and currently sits 
in the middle of its narrow range at roughly 336k. This stability may ease some concerns that have risen as a result of 
Wednesday's nonmanufacturing ISM report, detailed below. 
Nonmanufacturing ISM drops to lowest in four years 
February nonmanufacturing ISM fell to 51.6, down 2.4 points and was the lowest figure since the beginning of 2010. This 
cautions the actual momentum currently displayed in the economy. The ISM nonmanufacturing employment index was 
particularly disturbing, taking a 9 point plunge to 47.5, the largest one-month fall since late 2008. The supplier deliveries index 
(which rises when bad weather slows delivery times) rose by a mere half point, showing that recent weather may not have been 
that substantial. Despite this, one cannot rule out any weather impact.

52-Week Highs/Lows 

Net 13% of stocks hitting 52-week highs vs. 52-week lows 

It was a strong week for the Index, which gained 29 points over the past 5 days. So it comes as no surprise, that as we make new 
highs, we have a healthy % of stocks hitting their 52-week highs. Over this past week, we saw 27% of stocks hitting their 52week 
highs vs. 52-week lows. At the sector level, HealthCare and Materials had the greatest net % of stocks hitting their 52-week 
highs at 49% and 45%, respectively. On the Industry level, Airlines, Real Estate Management & Development and Construction 
Materials had 100% of their stocks hitting 52 week highs. There was only 1 industry (Air Freight & Logistics) where 52 week 
lows outnumbered 52 week highs.

covered companies by visiting https://jpmm.com/research/disclosures, calling 1-800-477-0406, or e-mailing 
research.disclosure.inquiries@jpmorgan.com with your request. J.P. Morgan’s Strategy, Technical, and Quantitative Research teams may

Explanation of Equity Research Ratings, Designations and Analyst(s) Coverage Universe: 

J.P. Morgan uses the following rating system: Overweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will outperform the 
average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Neutral [Over the next six to twelve 
months, we expect this stock will perform in line with the average total return of the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) 
coverage universe.] Underweight [Over the next six to twelve months, we expect this stock will underperform the average total return of 
the stocks in the analyst’s (or the analyst’s team’s) coverage universe.] Not Rated (NR): J.P. Morgan has removed the rating and, if 
applicable, the price target, for this stock because of either a lack of a sufficient fundamental basis or for legal, regulatory or policy 
reasons. The previous rating and, if applicable, the price target, no longer should be relied upon. An NR designation is not a 
recommendation or a rating. In our Asia (ex-Australia) and U.K. small-and mid-cap equity research, each stock’s expected total return is 
compared to the expected total return of a benchmark country market index, not to those analysts’ coverage universe. If it does not appear 
in the Important Disclosures section of this report, the certifying analyst’s coverage universe can be found on J.P. Morgan’s research 
website, www.jpmorganmarkets.com.
